He will be speaking at the Current Science & Technology Stage at 12:30 - stop by and check it out!<br /><br />About the film:<br />Volcanoes: The Fires of Creation is a tale of science, culture, and thrilling adventure! Earth is a planet born of fire. For billions of years, volcanoes have helped create the world we know. From the continents to the air we breathe and even life itself, all have their origins in fire. With over 500 active volcanoes, Earth is bursting at the seams with these forces of mass construction. The story of volcanoes is the story of the planet’s creation, and the story of us.<br /><br />With intrepid explorer Carsten Peter as your guide, dodge boulders at the edge of an active volcano in Indonesia, descend to a lava lake in Vanuatu, and visit the incredible mineral deposit fields in Ethiopia. Travel across the globe to see the archaeological ghost town of Pompeii and witness the devastating effects of the recent Kilauea eruption in Hawaii. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you discover molten worlds and exploding craters in this adrenaline-filled, immersive experience that only IMAX®/Giant Screen films can provide!",

Jonathan Van Ness, Emmy-winning star of Netflix’s “Queer Eye”, will come to the Museum for one night only with his popular podcast, Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness, on Wednesday, February 27th, 2019. This will be a live recording which will become a future episode of the podcast, and feature Jonathan exploring a science or health related topic with a special guest expert. The show will take place in the Blue Wing, with seating on the terrace level, and standing room on level 1 and 2.<br /><br />The show is being announced and tickets go live today, Wednesday, 9/19 at 9:00AM, and we will begin rolling out to the public and press that hour, with JVN making the exciting announcement shortly after. <br /><br />We wanted to share this exciting news with staff ahead of time. Tickets are limited and we are unable to hold or comp any tickets, so we urge interested folks to purchase sooner than later! GSE's will be made available shortly as well for those interested.<br /><br />Once again, we are thrilled to be bringing this important voice of today's culture to the Museum, and hope you all share that excitement! <br /><br />-James<br /><br />A RENO FAMILY FOUNDATION SYMPOSIUM— <br />Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness<br />Wednesday, February 27, 2019; 7:30pm<br />Blue Wing<br />Tickets: Seated- $35; Standing-$25; On sale Wednesday, September 19th at 9:00AM EST<br /><br />Television personality, Emmy winner, and hairstylist to the stars, Jonathan Van Ness comes to the Museum of Science for one night only! Enjoy a live taping of his popular podcast Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness.<br /><br />Growing up, Jonathan had a ravenous curiosity for learning new stuff (like his obsession with Finland) that defied the more common pursuits of midwestern boys. In Getting Curious: The Podcast, Jonathan’s curiosity marches on, exploring topics like the Armenian Genocide, Gravitational waves and the Romanovs to lighter fare featuring Margaret Cho or Denise Bidot on what it’s like being a model in fashion today. Each episode focuses on a different topic of interest, welcoming an expert in that particular field to satiate everyone’s curiosity. Jonathan has been turning out episodes since 2015, you will find Getting Curious on Earwolf, Libsyn or the Apple Podcast Store.<br /><br />Funding provided by the Reno Family Foundation Fund.<br /><br />Seating and standing room is general admission, so we encourage you to arrive early to guarantee your party is seated together. Doors to the show will open at 7:00 pm.",

		"messageBody": "Comment Card Report 7/1/18-7/31/18 Part 1<br /><br />“Disappointed that the Dora exhibit is ending soon! So many of the sections are a favorite with my 2.5 year old and when we say we are going to MOS, something in that room is what she says she'd like to do, the slide, planting the flowers, playing with the balls or checking the animals. The variety of little kid sized activities in there is awesome. Some sections don't have much at eye level for the toddler/pre-K set, though we do love many of the other areas of the MOS which have little kid oriented elements, like the \"\"sewer\"\" she can crawl in under the exhibit down on the bottom floor. The baby chicks are a great level for littles and others and the height chart with magnets nearby it is good access for shorties and grownups too. Would very much appreciate some more permanent or visiting areas which have interactive spaces workable for toddlers/pre-K.”<br /><br />“Hi! Just wanted to inform you of a bug on your webpage. On at least (assuming you recycle your javascipt) your \"\"Exhibits\"\" page (Home>Explore>Exhibits), your dialogue boxes, upon hovering, go full blown Tigger and keep bouncing. This is on Safari for MacOS Vs. 11.1. Thanks!”<br /><br />“Today we had the pleasure of going to the Discovery Center and working with the wonderful staff there.  In particular, Elizabeth worked with our 4 year old son to put together an ostrich skeleton.  We were extremely impressed with how she managed the different kids that came and left while our son stayed put.  He can be very shy and is petite so he can easily be overshadowed by other children.  She was very careful to include him in everything and listened to everything he said, no matter how quiet.  He will have many great memories thanks to her!”<br /><br />“So sad to see the Dora exhibit closing, we LOVE IT! Please ass more younger kid playspaces, it's a nice change to Discovery Center & especially useful for stay at home families with kids who don't go to school yet to do in the week. We have come more to MOS because of it.”<br /><br />“Came down for Night of Sky at Planetarium due to website looked like you were shown a lot of animals and person shaped in sky and presenter just showed 3 things in 45 minutes as a member I was upset.”<br /><br />“Please please please<br />1) Bring back the Dora exhibit (we know it leaves July 4th)<br />2) More exhibits like it for younger kids”<br /><br />“Love Dora room. Kiddo is only 20 mo. so we don't actually care about Dora. But a place for a toddler to climb and adventure! Yes!”<br />“More exhibits like the Dora exhibit”<br /><br />“Bye bye Dora please bring the exhibit back again. Soon.”<br /><br />“I visited the museum with my son this morning. I tried 5 different hand sanitizer stations and they were all empty. This was between 10 and 10:30 am so there is no way they had all been used up that morning. If you are going to have them out, please keep them filled.”<br /><br />“We visited the Hayden planetarium today and I had not been there for a number of years”<br /><br />\"Please explain why you're giving the stage of a kid/family museum to this event.  https://www.mos.org/public-events/summer-thursdays/drag”<br /><br />\"I was very disappointed to hear about the so called 'Drag Thursdays' now scheduled at your once fine publicly supported institution. Entirely inappropriate and offensive.  I will no longer support the MOS.”<br /><br />\"Hello! I recently visited the museum for the first time. It was a great experience. I learned a lot, but left wondering...  what becomes of the chicks hatched in the Hall of Human Life's hatchery after their tenure in the exhibit?  Thank you”<br /><br />\"Great visit, as usual. A suggestion: Many (not all) exhibits have only US measure units in their explanation text. Consider adding metric equvalents to all museum exhibits.\"\t<br /><br />“My charge (age 5) had an idea for an exhibit while eating lunch: the science and stickiness of grilled cheese!”<br /><br /> “Koby was great! The food court was clean, quick and inviting.<br />Love this.”<br /><br />“Hi - I have been a member for several years and, having guests this past week, pulled out my Omni passes to use on our visit. I discovered expiration dates such that it seems that none of these passes are any longer valid. What a disappointment. Retail stores can no longer invalidate gift cards for it was declared a deceptive practice. I ask that you reconsider this practice for the same reason. Such a practice leads me to reconsider my support for MOS. Thanks for considering.”<br /><br />“Can you please have someone clean the Flying Over The Atomic Landscape exhibit? It is filled with grime in the holes that you’re supposed to put the red/blue/green pegs in to.”<br /><br />“Math exhibit needs more acknowledgment of African culture and people. All science was stolen from African genius culture that white scientists profit from. That wall of scientists is ALL white people! White scientists owe reparations to African people.\"\t<br /><br />“Been to many museums worldwide. This one was the best! Thanks.\"\t\t<br /><br />“I've ended our membership with the museum.  Our family had been members for about 10 years.  I don't believe that drag performances align to the charter of the museum.  As such, I will contribute to other entities”<br /><br />“Toilet in basement men's room won't flush.”<br /><br />“Hello, I purchased two memberships today during my first visit. I was very disappointed to find that only one of the hand sanitizer dispensers in the entire indoor premises (the one near the stairwell to the Live Animal Center) was working. This was very disappointing, as there are a lot of germs being spread around and one of the exhibits in the Journey to Space event involves putting your hand in a glove. Please fix this going forward.”<br /><br />“Most staff was very kind and helpful.  The conditions of the women's bathroom in the blue wing (2nd and 3rd floor) was disgusting!  I was surprised and completely grossed out by the mess and smell in both bathrooms.  The cafe needs to be better organized.  It was REALLY busy today (due to the rainy weather) and the cafe was chaotic.  I have never visited a place and felt so frustrated as I did today.  I will NEVER visit the MOS on a rainy weekend again!!  I was thinking about becoming a member but I changed my mind today.”",

I came across your Drag Queen events on Thursdays in the Planetarium. First of all what in heavens names does this have to do with science and secondly what kind of education are you trying to provide to young minds?  Sure I cannot bring my grandchildren to the Museum in Thursday’s and avoid this exposure. But if this is where you are investing your dollars and programming, then I will not give one dollar of my money to the museum any day of the week. We have enjoyed bringing our kids and grandkids to the museum over the years. No more!”<br /><br />“When I bought my membership, I got a temporary card that’s valid for 14 days. However, wouldn’t it be better for it to be 21 days to cover the 3-4 week wait time for the actual card? I understand that we could just go to the box office to receive a temporary 1 day, but what if I didn’t receive the card until the end of the 4th week and went multiple times?”<br /><br />“Hi what T area are you closest too? Thx”<br /><br />“I was beyond impressed with a young gentleman who helped us when we were seeing \"\"dream big\"\"  at 3 PM. He was so accommodating and helped my 4 year old be comfortable in the theater. He is incredibly kind and patient and has excellent skills with children. i am a child psychiatrist so really impressed. Thank you! Please make sure he is recognized. An outstanding employee I apologize I can't recall his name! thank you!”<br /><br />“mrn was fantastic! We learned so much about Boston from her as opposed to everyone else we have met, despite tours. Absolutely great, glad we came!”<br /><br /> “My family visited the museum. Upon going through the gates at the exhibit hall we had an instance that I need to share with you which was very unpleasant. My 8 year old daughter was standing on the side of me while I was pushing a baby stroller and my husband and son were ahead of us.  The employee letting us through did not realize my daughter standing next to me was with us (not sure how because we were all standing together) and they screamed very loudly at my daughter and scared her immensely. I did not think this was necessary at all.  I told the employee she was our daughter and while my 8 yo started crying they did not even apologize or say anything at all.  Needless to say this ruined our experience and honestly upset my daughter to the point that she was upset about this for days.  It really made an impact on her.  I am not trying to sound dramatic but I feel this was very unnecessary what happened.  I wanted to pass this information on to you. Thank you for your time.”<br /><br />“Member feedback on frustration at MOS. First on more than one occasion, I have checked out at parking and entered the info and charge card before entering member card and therefore did not get 2 hr free parking. this is because I am an English reader and read top to bottom left to right. the last thing at station is member card at bottom right. could you place a reminder for members to enter member card first? second I have emailed the member email about this after a frustrating experience and did not receive a response. third I was there ayt April vacation in a long line waiting to purchase tics for a long time until a volunteer asked if there were members in line because there was a special short line for members to purchase or pick up tics. A sign would have saved a half hour waiting with young children.”",

		"messageBody": "We generated a new Comment Card Report-June 6, 2018-June 30, 2018<br /><br />“Why did you discontinue the Let's Celebrate 4th of July! Member event? So disappointing!”<br /><br />“ The museum was fun for myself, my husband and 3 young nieces. However, in your In The Kitchen exhibit, my 5 year old niece unfortunately infested some of the water that was part of the exhibit. She became very ill with diarrhea and dehydration the very next day. I do not think it is wise to have a hands on exhibit that would invite young children to drink the liquids that have been exposed to bacteria and harmful microorganisms from every person that comes into contact with it. These are very young children who will impulsively drink from a paper cup that they often drink from. It’s a very unsafe exhibit which caused my niece to become terribly ill. It should be enclosed so that others do not have the same unfortunate incident.”<br /> <br />\"Sometimes the lines to purchase items in the museum gift shop are prohibitively long.  Perhaps you might consider adding a temporary cash register station during the times when there are school field trips (end of the school year).  Other than that, the museum caters so well to the student population during the crush of end-of-the-year field trips.  Thank you so much!”<br /><br />“Trying to register to give a gift membership.  The web page keeps telling me my address is invalid.  Help!”<br /><br />“Just an idea: maybe start an urban garden here at the museum which could be used for education as well as for the cafe/education (https://greencitygrowers.com). Also maybe start composting to use in the garden.”<br /><br />\"As a longtime Museum of Science member and former freelance employee, I object to the policy of having unused passes expire at the end of the membership year. I have paid for them and should have the use of them for as long as my membership is current. This was your policy with paper passes but apparently changed with the introduction of electronic passes. I think the expiration of passes is a disservice to loyal members like me!”<br /><br />“ James Otis Students really enjoyed the scholarship that allowed them to visit the Museum on June 6th. They learned a lot and had a great time.THANKS!”<br /><br />“I would like to see an OMNI film on the Northern Lights. Thank you”<br /><br />“Kobie Garcia, the Cafe Manager in the Museum of Science was so wonderful!  We were on a visit with 45 students and our tour company neglected to make lunch reservations to ensure we’d have somewhere to sit together.  Kobie arranged for us to have a spot in the reserved area anyway and with a waterfront view to boot!! So accommodating and kind!”<br /><br />“Please label the cats in the natural Wonder Exhibit.”<br /><br />“It takes too long to knock them down.\"\t\t<br /><br />“Please don't have live animals in your exhibits. This is cruel and unnecessary.”<br /><br />“ Just wanted to say that I live in Joliet Illinois and the lightning bugs have massively increased in the last 2 years in my area.”<br /><br />“I have a couple of ideas for exhibits. Do you take suggestions of this kind? If so, who should I contact?”<br /><br />“Hi, we were visting the museum this week and, while in the Red Wing discovering our universe, we noticed a slight typo. There's a place describing radio waves and how they're measured and recorded. On it it mentions the ALMA device located in Atacama, Chile. However, you have it spelled as ALTACAMA, with an L. Probably a slight oversight, but I figured I'd point it out to you.”<br /><br />\"Linda at Omni brought my daughter's lost hat and brought it up to us in the theater. She was so sweet to do that.”<br /><br />“Loved everything! Except for the live animal exhibits. It's inhumane. All else great!”<br /><br />“The Space exhibit is fantastic.  And I think The Museum of Science should have lots of stuff like it as permanent exhibits.  Space content is woefully underrepresented in The Museum and this exhibit not only highlighted that fact but also showed how well it can be done.  The rotating simulator wouldn't be necessary, of course, but any of the smaller parts of the exhibit would be great additions.”<br /><br />“We have SO enjoyed the Dora kid play space!  My kids could spend hours in there.  Our family would love to see more of those types of things for the younger kiddos at the museum.”<br /><br />“Please can you put the taco stand back. It makes no sense that there are two stands with burgers and hot dogs. So can you please bring the taco stand back.”<br /><br />“Roof top garden outside the bee exhibit!”<br /><br />“More toddler spaces like the Dora exhibit or water area like at the children’s museum.”",

One whole level is blocked off for construction, which is understandable.  However, there should be a limit on how many cars are allowed in when there are no spaces. Specially when there are frustrated drivers going through a parking garage with kids.\"<br /><br />\"The whole grain salads on today's salad bar were all awesome! Please have them more often.\"\t\t<br /><br />\"Lots of people eating in the exhibit halls - tons of food in space ship<br />*unsafe for allergies!\"<br /><br />\"I got your email about membership appreciation day this Sunday. Immediately tried to sign up and couldn't and eventually called and was advised it was sold out within 5 minutes of opening--The items I wanted are not available. I feel more like the victim of a bait and switch than an appreciated member. Please don't send anymore emails.\"<br /><br />\"Hi: I have been a member of your place probably more than 10 years with my kids and previously other years when I was single. I have to say that i enjoyed the musuem a lot ... and now with kids even more. However I want to say how disappointing is your membership appreciation night. I have been trying the complimentary tickets online. The opening was at 11 am . It is 11:05 and there were gone. I understand that is first come first serve, however it sounds unfair for all your members.  I am sure that a lot of them are disappointed at this time. Is there any other way that you can give the free tickets, maybe as a lottery ? or Maybe don’t do it at all... I do not like to see after 5 min of the offer: We were unable to add the seats to your cart. There may be insufficient availability Thank you for your consideration.”<br /><br />“Hello, I went to go see the Beyonce Experience last night, 9/22/2018, and I was extremely disappointed. The word I would use would be bizarre. I had to leave early as it truly made no sense. I was not the only one.”<br /><br />\"I recently attented a showing of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon laser show at the Charles Hayden Planetarium.  Although I overall enjoyed the show, I was particularly impressed by the background projections that take you through mountainscapes, space, and other psychedelic worlds.  Out of all the people who went with me to the laser show and that I spoke with after, all agreed that the laser projection itself was kind of cheesy and distracting from the beautiful projections that were going on behind the laser.  Laser light showings like this have been around since the 70's and although it was considered impressive then to see a laser show playing with your favorite album, the technology portrayed behind the scenes at the Hayden planetarium far surpasses the technology of the laser itself and makes it look like a screen saver from Windows 95'.  I just wanted to give my feedback that I think all who attend the musicly inspired laser shows at the planetarium would like to see the technology of the planetarium itself fully utilized to create vast moving images that give the viewer an almost unlimited view of projection.  The laser itself only fills the top middle portion of the theater, while the background imagery filled the entire screen.\"<br /><br />\"I am from Chester County Pennsylvania and I am still seeing firflies at dusk here in my yard - September 28 th. I have never seen them previously that late in the year.\"<br /><br />\"Hello. I am currently living Maine . I grew up in Cambridge. I took my daughter here when we were in town for another reason which we are every couple months. We had a late entry but we were told at the desk that she stamped our tickets and we could come back anytime within the next 6 months. Well when i put the tickets in my pocket the stamp smeared and it just looks like two ink smudges on our tickets. I was very disappointed when I saw this .    I went to your museum a lot as a kid, I loved it. Field trips as well.  It was a huge part of my childhood . To take my daughter back here and explore it with her and just see the same glimmer in her eyes was amazing. Unfortunately we arrived too late for a lot of the shows , the butterfly room or anything and did not get to see all the exhibits but We still payed full price.   I would love to bring my daughter back here and explore the museum fully and really make another trip out of it . Was wondering if these tickets were still good to get us back in even though its smudged. I can send you pictures of the tickets if  that helps.    It was a Child and an Adult Ticket.    Thank You for years and years of happiness and memories and look forward to being back there again with my family .    Thank You\"<br /><br />“Please consider an exhibit dedicated to the science of human nutrition.”",

As is the entire Charles River section. Well done. I would be curious about the experience designers.”<br /><br />“We brought our 13 and 15 year old Finnish grandsons to the Museum. They and I were disappointed in the number of parents who let their smaller children loose to just bang on all the buttons ( since they couldn’t read yet) and take up the time older kids needed to try out the different exhibits. I wish the staff would patrol or post the need for parents to keep track of toddlers and kids who shouldn’t be abusing the exhibit controls. My grandchildren are from Finland and were really astounded by this behavior.”<br /><br />\"Hello! I visited the museum last weekend - it is fantastic!! I just wanted to point out that in the natural science areas, there's a tree leaf matching game... some of the leaves aren't labeled correctly (ex: a red ginko leaf is labeled as an English Hawthorne). Just wanted to let you know so as to make your museum as great as possible!\"\t<br /><br />\"Plaque explaining how often the pendulum knocks over pieces. We wanted to watch it hit a piece but with no info on how it works that couldn't happen.\"<br /><br />\"Have better postcards. Only two specific to the museum is depressing.\"\t<br /><br />\"The guest spoke to a friend whose father suffers from macular degeneration. She brought her father to an Omni show, and perhaps due to the size of the screen and/or the curved surface, he was able to see the film as if he had no visual impairment. He was deeply moved to have such an opportunity. The guest suggested this was something we could promote and hopefully reach more people with this condition.\"<br /><br />\"While in the dinosaur room, I noticed how none of the exhibits mentioned how these beautiful creatures once possessed feathers. We now know they did, so the exhibit overall lacked a bit of an update.\"\t<br /><br />\"Went to the lightning show with my nieces and nephew. People were continuously standing on the red carpet although it was announced multiple times people still stood blocking the children's view. DO NOT PLAN ON COMING BACK.\"<br /><br />“While eating in the cafe, the guest saw dirigibles further down the river. He thought it would be a good idea to get dirigibles to fly close to the Museum - for advertising, perhaps, and also to get kids to think about science.”<br /><br />\"On the third floor, in the Weems sculpture exhibit, I believe one of the sculptures is mislabeled. It is labeled ‘Clydesdale Stallion,’ but I'm pretty sure the title is mixed up with the neighboring one. The rest of the info does appear correct.\"<br /><br />\"Went to the ‘Lightning’ show - disaster! No staff directing crowds, staff person running the show had to continually stop show to ask people to move to designed areas. Worst live show experience, should have more staff to control crowd flow.\"<br /><br />\"Good day:<br />My grandson is in one of the Summer programs. I happened to be in the Charles River exhibit by myself when the students arrived. I observed the tutors in charges of the group. They were sitting looking at the children as they ran from exhibit to exhibit with no orientation or direction. As an ex-teacher and principal of an elementary school I recommend the following:<br />The tutors need to be trained on how to _engage_ the students. They need to be actively involved in provoking questions and structuring an overview of the exhibit.<br />As to the exhibit itself, it needs some monitoring. For example, the Turbidity exhibit has three tubes for observation, algae, clear water, and one more. The most turbid was the clear water due to the interior condensation leading to an erroneous conclusion that clear water is the most turbid because the Secchi disk is barely visible.<br />Charles River<br />-Aquatic insects audio guide not working<br />-Monitoring the Charles River EPA data is over a year old and some indicators register nothing.”<br /><br />“Our experience at the museum today is a good example of why we did not renew our membership last year, and why we have stopped recommending the museum as a ‘can't miss’ attraction to our friends who visit the area. As great as the museum is, it seems there is always something that ruins the experience. A special thank you to the custodian in the food court, who was in such a rush to sweep under our table that he literally swept our legs and feet, and then continued to do so EVEN HARDER after we asked them very politely to stop. And another special thank you to the staff at the Information desk who wouldn't take a complaint and said ‘they're separate; go back and complain to them’). We will not be returning to the museum anymore.”<br /><br />\"Why would you spend all the time and money for a museum and have such a poor, unclear website and then have no one to talk to when a call is placed.   I planned on visiting and will not longer.Lots to do but not able to plan a day, lack of info due to poor management.  I was trying to coordinate a day for a small group but cannot develop any type of syllabus\"<br /><br />“Just want to say that Mia in the little kids Discovery Center was awesome! She went above and beyond all expectations. My kids love her!!!”\t<br /><br />“We arrived at the virtual reality ride for our scheduled time, but my daughter started to not feel well due to low blood sugar (she is 10 and type 1 diabetic). Sam was so kind and helpful in allowing us to reschedule and wait until our daughter's blood glucose level was in a safe range after a snack. Thank you!!\"\t\t<br /><br />“I want to thank George from security. He helped to find my phone. He was awesome and really helpful. Thank you, George!! You are the best!”<br /><br />“Please increase the cleaning times in cafe men + women's bathrooms. 4 toilets out of 5 were disgusting when I opened women's stalls. Feces over filled with T/P. Gross. Please increase cleaning to adjust for peak times.”",

With the EcoMod system, we can undertake a complete modernization, replacing all existing components within the surrounding structure and truss with brand new technology, therefore minimizing downtime and visitor impact. The EcoMod system will also eliminate the need for structural modifications to the Blue Wing’s Lower Level and First Floor as a traditional replacement would have required.<br /><br />Additional EcoMod features include: <br />•Improved ride and passenger safety through fully synchronized step and handrail movement<br />•Ensures smooth, constant deceleration improving passenger safety<br />•Constantly monitors speed, direction, safety status, and other operating parameters to enhance safety and maintenance diagnostics<br />•Modifications that reduce handrail drag, reducing maintenance downtime<br /><br />How Will This Impact Museum Day to Day Operations?<br />•All four escalators will be completed simultaneously in order to minimize disruption to the Visitor Experience.<br />•The total project will take 16 weeks, spanning from mid to late August to early December. (We currently are targeting Sunday night August 19th thru December 18th) <br />•Eight foot high barriers will surround the construction areas. (These barriers will affect the pedestrian passage between the escalators on the 1st floor, adjacent to the CS&T stage.) <br />•Guests will be directed to use the stairwells and elevators with the same signage we currently use during escalator breakdowns and wayfinding will be adjusted to properly direct guests. <br />•Construction will take place from early morning hours into mid-afternoon, during museum operating hours, and will have the similar sounds of active construction to those of the Yawkey Gallery on the Charles River, Lobby, or Concourse renovations. <br />•We are working closely with Kone and various Museum Departments with the Museum Wide Calendar to schedule deliveries, off hour work, and the associated impacts. <br /><br />Thank you in advance for your cooperation as we work to improve the functionality of our vertical transportation within the building.

They established the Jared Branfman Sunflowers For Life Fund For Pediatric Brain And Spinal Cancer Research at the Jimmy Fund. All the money raised by Team Kermit goes through the PMC and into our fund. It supports research into the type of disease that Jared had and is helping to make the dream of no more cancer a reality. It is a fitting legacy to Jared's wish to help others.<br /><br />This year I joined Team Kermit. What better year to do it that 2018? In Jewish culture the number 18 has special meaning and is associated with life, in Hebrew Chai (with a hard ch). Numerically, the word consists of the eighth (chet) and tenth (yud) letters of the Hebrew alphabet, adding up to eighteen the number 18.<br />I am asking you to donate in multiples of 18 to give a life: 18, 36, 54, 78, 90, 108 etc<br />Join us in our fight to rid the world of this terrible disease so that your children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren never have to hear the word cancer again.

While we were takiing a break we had some difficulty with the self serve vending machines, which your Cafe Manager, Kobie Garcia remedied with prompt and professional skill. His service was greatly appreciated. I just wanted to let you know of his excellent service and hope you know that his extroidinary service really made our day.”<br /><br />“I strongly suggest you have a large display of evolution of earth and evolution of man!”<br /><br />“I attended the evening event and it would have been so nice to have a coffee! Can you keep Starbucks open for evening events?”<br /><br />“I found the Exhibits too elementary and not well coordinated. A person cannot develop an understanding of the subject from them.”<br /><br />“My girlfriend and I recently came to the museum while in Boston as it was recommended to do so online. After spending an overpriced admission fee we began to explore the facility. We both have been to museums of science in other cities before and greatly enjoyed them but did not at your facility. Nearly everything on display was childish and insulting to anyone other than a child. If it were a children's museum the advertising and representation done by your organization is clearly off. We left after less than an hour in the facility and would definitely not recommend to anyone who is not going with a child. Thank you for a waste of time and money.”<br /><br />“Hello. I am a long time premiere member and my son has celiac disease which means he can’t eat gluten. I was shocked to find out - after asking a cafeteria manager - that one have no gluten free food options. While I understand that technically the salad bar options are gluten free, they are easily cross contaminated and not sage for those with celiac. Most similar museums and amusement parks now offer gluten free buns, pizza and pasta. I strongly suggest you find a way to offer safe gluten free items to your guests”<br /><br />“Yesterday was my birthday and my son and I spent the day in Boston.  Being that it was so rainy and cold, I bought tickets for the museum and we decided to check it out.  We arrived at 3 p.m., and were saddened to see that one of the wings closed within an hour and it appeared that a lot of exhibits were closed.  We did not realize that most of the shows were early on in the day and that we would be arriving at the wrong time.  I feel that I spent $56 to see a few displays and a snake.  I feel it was not at all worth the money spent for less than two hours.”<br /><br />“As a member, I love getting the monthly email notifications, so I can plan my visits. But I have now received spam about this damn stargazing quiz at least three times.  Moreover, I can't see any way to unsubscribe from terrible spam like this without also unsubscribing from notifications of museum calendars. If I have to, I”<br /><br />“I do not know who to contact about the cams on your roof, but the cam facing east has a wrong time setting, it is 1 hour earlier than it really is. DST does not start for another week. Just so you know, whoever is caring for the cams has made a mistake here. Thank you.”<br /><br /><br />“Please bring back the quesadilla station in the cafe. I love those quesadillas and I miss them very much. Have a nice day!”<br /><br /><br />“Hello there. I submitted a comment regarding a recent visit and my experience. We had a very bad experience which affected my daughter immensely due to a member of your staff. I’m very disappointed that no one has even responded with an email at all. I understand that there’s many departments but I would of expected something at least via email by now.”<br /><br /> “I am not finding much information on your website about which exhibits are good for toddlers.  Can you tell me what exhibits/activities you have for kids around 2 years of age?” <br /><br />“Dear Membership Team, Thank you so much for thinking of us and sending four free passes!! It is a very thoughtful and touching gesture!”",

This is blatantly false.<br />Secondly, the cancer exhibit neglects in ITS ENTIRETY to address prevention,reversing and curing cancer is DIET. Cancer does not fall from the sky. It is based on a person making perfecting cells. Cells can only be made through GOOD<br />NUTRITION, and healthy lifestyle choices. Why is this not even touched upon?<br />Children, in particular, should know they have choices!”<br /><br />“The museum always makes me starry-eyed.”<br /><br />“Like, bro, those laws of motion man... there's like... so much gravity to them.”<br /><br />“I hope whoever read these cards today has a wonderful day! <3”<br /><br />“The museum is wonderful and so is just about everyone who works there!”<br /><br />“I still haven’t received the premium membership of 2 even after I directly paid in person for our membership and visit. Please check and send it asap.”<br /><br />“Please PLEASE look into In Saturn's Rings..!”<br /><br />“Looking to purchase B & W Alaska photos. Like we did in the 80's ! Is this still available ? Thank You”<br /><br />“We visited the museum and the experience was awesome EXCEPT purchased 2 items at the store for the grandkids. One, the lava lamp, worked on night then quit. I don't have my receipt but do know spent $46.69 total. Is there anyway can<br />be reimbursed for the lamp? Lastly loved the mirror maze.. Thank you in<br />advance”<br /><br />“While normally I have a stress free and great experience at the Museum of Science, today was different. One of the employees was rude to both me and my brother who is special needs. I do understand that there are many signs around<br />the butterfly garden that way that you may not touch the butterflies. However,there is not much room in the garden allowing for room to walk around. We were yelled at about touching butterflies, but had only disturbed a couple of plants by moving over for people. The other employees were so nice.<br /><br />“on 5/3 can't seem to get tickets into cart”<br /><br />“So you have passes for the Journey to the South Pacific IMAX showing on Sunday evening for members - these were made available at 11AM today. Here it is not even 2PM and I've been informed that they sold out by noon. Wow, thanks a lot.<br />So if someone is working & in meetings they're out of luck I guess. I don't think I'll be renewing it when it expires at the end of this month.”<br /><br />“Please consider toilet seat covers. The flush sends a whirlwind of bacteria 10 feet in all directions. Otherwise, I love this Museum.\"<br /><br />“I really enjoyed the whole Museum except the Mirror Maze was too small.\"<br /><br />“We miss the Weather Exhibit in the electricity wing. Also, my boys miss the running exhibit at the playground.\"<br /><br />“More ink in stamps. Darker skin tones hard to see.\"<br /><br />“Hello, My family visited the museum this past Monday and had a wonderful time! I wanted to share a really exceptional interaction between my sons (2 and 4yrs) and Carol from the Discovery Room. She was so enthusiastic and answered<br />all of my sons’ questions showing them all kinds of amazing items. My 4yr old is obsessed with prehistoric sharks and was beyond happy to hold a Megladon tooth and see how big they would have been. When he returned to preschool yesterday he ran up to his teacher to tell her what he saw “I met this really nice lady who made the trip special...” Thank you to Carol who did in fact make our trip special!<br />:)”<br /><br />“I recently took my 4 year old for her first trip to the Museum of Science. We had<br />a wonderful time, but I especially wanted to share how much we enjoyed the temporary Dora & Diego exhibit. We don't watch Dora, but the exhibit was small and perfect for kids her age. There were seats for the adults so we could sit and<br />observe while the kids had fun - my girl played with other kids and had a wonderful time. It is a small exhibit but we were there for at least an hour. The staff suggested I let you know how much we enjoyed it. Many thanks.”<br /><br />“Just wondering if the free Omni passes that you get each year with membership ever expire?\"<br /><br />“We had so much fun on our visit to MoS on Friday May 18th and we wanted to say how grateful we were to Carol, one of your amazing Educators that made sure our visit with my little one was great. When we were in the Discovery Area, she reminded us about the Dora and Diego exhibit which sure was a hit with my five year old. Imagine our surprise when Carol popped up at that exhibit after we had<br />made a stop for lunch in your cafeteria. She was so knowledgeable about all the exhibits and the new ones that will be coming this summer, she sure made us realize it was time to get our Family Membership. See you all this Summer.”<br /><br />“Years ago I saw a movie at the IMAX theater with some wonderful footage from the Space Shuttle. I believe it was \"\"The Dream is Alive\"\" from what I find on the web. Personally, this was the best IMAX movie I had ever seen mainly because it fits that theater format so perfectly. Is there any chance you will bring this back<br />for a new showing?”",

		"messageBody": "Almost ten years ago the Museum of Science took a stand against single use plastic bags in the Museum Store based on our experience working with the Charles River Clean Up Boat, and the widespread attention the movement was just beginning to get back then. We immediately started selling Museum of Science branded reusable bags at a great price and offered free compostable bags for retail purchases as well. Fast forward ten years and we have dropped the compostable bags completely from the store(they look like plastic), converted to paper bags for retail purchases, and we will soon have new and improved reusable bags that are even better than the current ones and they reflect our latest brand. Ten years ago we were ahead of the movement, and while it was not without some challenges, we were very pleased with the outcomes. <br /><br />And now I am writing to let you know we are banning single use plastic straws in the café. Single use plastic straws have been eliminated in most major aquariums and zoos for almost ten years, and now that movement is spreading everywhere else. Essentially plastic straws are the new plastic bags. The reason for this is the overwhelming negative press that all single use plastic is getting worldwide, as the materials are not able to break down naturally, it creates massive amounts of litter everywhere, it kills wildlife, and the fact that microplastics are being found throughout the world’s oceans which is literally changing the world we live in. <br /><br />Effective immediately we have removed single use plastic straws from the condiment areas in the café. In order to accomplish this we have changed the lid on the fountain soda cup to ones that have an open slot, just like the Starbucks hot coffee lids we have used for years, and we will be supplying similarly designed lids for cold Starbucks drinks as well. We will individually hand out the Starbucks green compostable straws to all guests purchasing a frozen drink, and make these same straws available ,upon request, for Starbucks guests who have purchased a cold beverage where you would be accustomed to using a straw and for which the new lid does not work well. In addition, we will have these same compostable straws available at all point of sale stations (not in view) for any guests that requests a straw for any reason. Lastly, in certain cases it makes sense to have a straw for catered events, and in these scenarios we will use paper straws.<br /><br />We will add some language to the www.mos.org/accessibility letting guests know they can request a straw from any member of the café staff. And we will ensure café staff are trained to provide these straws on demand if requested. I will also post something on Quark for Museum staff. <br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions at all.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Jonathan",

In addition to her various roles in Interpretation, she was a Fellow with Live Presentations and an Ed Associate with the Hall of Human Life.  Becky's last day as Interpretation Coordinator will be Saturday, July 7th, but due to a variety of vacation plans, we'll celebrate her new directions the week before.  <br /><br />Join us in Hornblower between 3:30 and 4:30 on Tuesday, June 26th to share stories, activities, and snacks!  <br /><br />We'll head across the street to Lingos (new building) at 5.",

During this maintenance window you may experience brief outages where servers, business applications, and or files may not be accessible both internally and externally. To ensure uptime and stability of our platform, we are performing this upgrade shortly after close of business so we can maximize our efforts to ensure business operations will not be impacted when we open the next day. <br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns please contact the Service Desk team at x0130. <br /><br />We thank you in advance for your attention and understanding.",

This has enabled the Museum to improve how we manage, store and backup much of our unstructured content. <br /> <br />What Does This Mean?<br />Information Technology will use the new device to replace our existing Zeus file server.  After a successful pilot over the past few months, we will finalize the migration of all Zeus shared folders and home directories on our regularly scheduled June Maintenance night on 6/12 starting at 6pm. <br /> <br />What Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?<br />Do not panic! We will be retaining all file and folder permissions and will be retaining the existing “Zeus” naming convention in order to maintain how users currently connect to shared resources.<br /> <br />For PC/Windows users, this will not introduce any changes to the way you connect to your Zeus shares.  However, Mac users that do not currently connect to Zeus via the SMB connection (i.e CIFS) will need to be remapped on the morning of 6/13/18 in order to access the shares.  Our service desk will be ready to help with this change and you should contact us immediately for assistance.<br /> <br />What Do I Need To Do?<br />In order to prepare for the final migration of data to the new device we ask that users close out of all shared museum file directories and personal work drives on the night of June 12th before 6pm so that IT can work with Dell EMC and maximize our final migration window.  If files and folders are not closed out, IT will close them to ensure that the data is properly migrated to the new device.  To avoid losing changes to files please close out of all files and folders promptly before 6pm.<br /><br />Please note that staff should not store non-work related items (music, personal photos, videos, etc.) on Zeus shared museum file directories and home directories, in keeping with the Museum’s Technology Resource Policy. This will help us keep up with the demand for storage needs and retain a longer backup retention policy for museum related work needs.  In the future, if you need additional storage capacity for your home directory, you can call the service desk or submit a request online.<br /> <br />As always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.<br /> <br />Thank you,<br /><br />Pat",

We look forward to hosting 35 Interns and 11 Program Assistants across 8 different departments in the Museum. Please say hello if you spot one of our great Youth this summer!<br /><br />In addition to working in their home departments, interns will participate in 6 weeks of workshops, consisting of professional development on various topics and off-site STEM/Cultural field trips. These workshops will be held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from July 10th through August 16th in the Gordon Wing classroom.<br /><br />Want to get involved? We will be posting GSEs later this summer for field trip chaperones on the week of July 22nd and the week of August 19th. These will be a fun half-day opportunity to support our Youth as we explore local organizations together. <br /><br />Have additional questions?

		"messageBody": "This Saturday 5/26 at 11:30, we will have author Richard Munson at the CS&T Stage promoting his new book 'Tesla: Inventor of the Modern'. Come by and hear all about Nikola Telsa's life and accomplishments!<br /><br />\"Tesla’s inventions transformed our world, and his visions have continued to inspire great minds for generations.<br /><br />Nikola Tesla invented the radio, robots, and remote control. His electric induction motors run our appliances and factories, yet he has been largely overlooked by history. In Tesla, Richard Munson presents a comprehensive portrait of this farsighted and underappreciated mastermind.<br /><br />When his first breakthrough—alternating current, the basis of the electric grid—pitted him against Thomas Edison’s direct-current empire, Tesla’s superior technology prevailed. Unfortunately, he had little business sense and could not capitalize on this success. His most advanced ideas went unrecognized for decades: forty years in the case of the radio patent, longer still for his ideas on laser beam technology. Although penniless during his later years, he never stopped imagining. In the early 1900s, he designed plans for cell phones, the Internet, death-ray weapons, and interstellar communications. His ideas have lived on to shape the modern economy.<br /><br />Who was this genius? Drawing on letters, technical notebooks, and other primary sources, Munson pieces together the magnificently bizarre personal life and mental habits of the enigmatic inventor. Born during a lightning storm at midnight, Tesla died alone in a New York City hotel. He was an acute germaphobe who never shook hands and required nine napkins when he sat down to dinner. Strikingly handsome and impeccably dressed, he spoke eight languages and could recite entire books from memory. Yet Tesla’s most famous inventions were not the product of fastidiousness or linear thought but of a mind fueled by both the humanities and sciences: he conceived the induction motor while walking through a park and reciting Goethe’s Faust.<br /><br />Tesla worked tirelessly to offer electric power to the world, to introduce automatons that would reduce life’s drudgery, and to develop machines that might one day abolish war. His story is a reminder that technology can transcend the marketplace and that profit is not the only motivation for invention. This clear, authoritative, and highly readable biography takes account of all phases of Tesla’s remarkable life.",

		"messageBody": "Hi all,<br /><br />We're hosting a Forum event this Tuesday that might be of interest to many of you.  The program is called \"What's In Your Fish?\" and deals with the tradeoffs of neurotoxins in seafood, in the context of the well-known benefits of seafood consumption for brain development in young children and expecting/recent mothers.  We are co-presenting this event with the Boston University Superfund Research Program (BUSRP), for whom we are a subaward on their federal NIEHS grant.  We developed the forum materials in collaboration with BUSRP partners and a board of advisors from the local EPA office, Massachusetts state regulators, and other kinds of community and scientific experts.<br /> <br />The 90-minute Forum event will feature two consecutive case studies, each lasting about 40 minutes.  It’s taking place connected to a conference of Superfund Research Program grantees that will be happening that afternoon here at MOS. First, Kate Crawford from BU will talk about how researchers can assess and communicate risk about toxics in fish and then participants will consider and discuss a local case study about Chelsea Creek, which is part of the Mystic River and has experienced a history of environmental health challenges.  <br /><br />Then, Celia Chen, Professor of Environmental Health at Dartmouth College in NH, will present her research about toxics in fish to the public that can impact the particularly vulnerable populations of with young children and pregnant women/prospective moms.  Participants will then discuss and design a risk advisory for how they would want to be advised of these risks as consumers and community members. <br /> <br />Here's the link to sign up - the program is free but pre-registration is strongly encouraged.  https://www.mos.org/public-events/whats-in-your-fish.

What gives?”<br /><br />\"I recently became a member of Museum of Science, but I have been going for a very long time, first as an international student in Boston, and now as a father.  I have continually witnessed how great of an institution the MoS has become.  My two boys can easily spend the whole day in there, without blinking.  So, all is great, but one BIG thing: that is that the truly subpar quality of the meals offered there.  I am saddened to witness time and time again how the advancements in technology, for example (as witnessed by the great exhibitions in the MoS that couldn't have been possible a few years ago), never match with should be a core for each child's life: a healthy and balanced meals.  And by that I mean the whole food court at the MoS starting with subpar pizzas, clam chowder soups from the can, non-organic salads, milk of the lowest quality (Garelick, if I recall), sodas, etc.”<br /><br />“I would like to express my extreme displeasure at the new \"paperless vouchers\"  which are now being used instead of the paper passes one would get with one's membership.”<br /><br />“Loved your Science Museum! BEST we've ever visited :)<br />Only suggestion is for the \"make a/engineer a waterway\" - our son (and another kid we observed) stepped off/fell off of the stools...”<br /><br />“I would like to make you some suggestions about the people that are in the ticket box. They are not kind. Moreover, this museum should be an icon of the Boston's tourism, and it isn't with this kind of behavior and bad manners.<br />Also, you haven't complaint forms. You should have (such as most of the good museum in the USA, NYC...) special free passes for journalists to make some comments and articles about the museum and Boston, but unfortunately you don't have too.<br />I am looking forward to hearing from you.”<br /><br />“Please bring back the tater tots to the cafe.”<br /><br />“Karen who did the presentation on lightning was absolutely phenomenal! She was the highlight of my visit by far. 10/10 would watch her again.”<br /><br />“I came in with my 3 Y old granddaughter and she loved it here. My only complaint is that the cafe closes before the Discovery Center. The cafe should stay open. Thank you.”<br /><br />“Pink Floyd the Wall was horrible. I felt like I paid to watch a giant screen saver that made me feel sick and dizy.”<br /><br />“There is a spelling mistake on the placard titled ‘Radio Waves’ in the astronomy exhibit adjacent to the entrance of the planetarium.

We will be working closely with our external solutions provider, Aqueduct, in this endeavor. <br /><br />What Does This Mean?<br /><br />In preparation of this upgrade, IT will be performing an out of band network maintenance on Monday, August 27th beginning at 8:30pm.  This will allow us to patch our existing network equipment to ensure things go smoothly on Staff Appreciation day.  <br /><br />During the upgrade on 9/4/18, some Museum IT services will periodically be without connectivity during the hours of 9am and 5pm on that day.   Email will continue to function, as that is hosted offsite with Microsoft.  Our main website, www.mos.org, will also be up (with appropriate messaging for visitors).  The main phone line will have the recording available as well. <br /><br />What Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?<br /><br />All internal systems (VPN, Zeus, internal phones, applications, guest wireless, DMZ, and Internet based services, etc.) will periodically be unavailable throughout the course of the day.<br /><br />What Do I Need To Do?<br /><br />If you are not going to be in the office on 9/3/18, please close out of all MOS applications and shared files prior to leaving the building.  <br /><br />As always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org  or call x0130.",

		"messageBody": "Comment Card report 7/1/18-7/31/18 Part 2<br /><br />“Dear museum staff, in your hall for mathematics and statistics you mention Omar Khayam but nowhere do you mention where he’s from. Sure, I know where all those cities such as Esfahan or esphahan are, but your audience doesn’t. Earasing Iran from the origins of mathematics and medicine is a small yet significant way in which an institution can contribute to world conflict. For example the father of the theory of probability was from the Middle East and math, science, and medicine have their origins in China, India, and Iran, iraq, and Syria. We know what has already happened to Iraq and Syria, in no small part because the people in the western countries no nothing about those nations. Erase them from history and you will be part of the forces and destroy those nations and cultures. Keep them in history and people will support their governments less in war and more in peace with those nations. Choose your side and I will choose if I visit again. But as a public school teacher, I was rather appalled by yet one more example of an institution focused on science and education, keeping history Eurocentric and conveniently erasing the founders and major contributors.”<br />“Thank you MOS for a great time last week.  Our two children (10yo and 6yo) had a blast!  As a parent, the best part for me was the cafe.  I say this because our oldest has a long list of allergies and it’s always hard going places (especially those far from home like the MOS) because we usually have to pack a lot of food from home.  However, I called the museum ahead of time and was able to get ahold of someone in the kitchen. He assured me that there were things that met my daughter’s allergy needs.  He also told me to speak directly to the Cafe Manager, Kobie Garcia.  When we got to the museum, we went directly to the cafe so I could check in with Kobie and make sure that there REALLY WAS food that my daughter could eat, as it almost seemed a little too good to be true. He met me with a smile and said he was expecting me.  He walked me through the options available (there was more than enough).  When my husband brought the kids back to the cafe and I gave my daughter all the options.  Naturally she was ELATED to feel like she fit in with everyone else, ordering off the same menu.  On top of that, Kobie even told me to bring the kids back for a surprise after they finished eating.  When the kids finished lunch and we found Kobie again, he had complimentary cups of Dippin Dots for them, including one of the very few flavors my daughter can actually eat and loves!  Kobie was so great and accommodating, never making me feel like we were a burden. It was the first time in a long time that things felt “normal” for my daughter and I am forever grateful for that. Thank you MOS for s great day and for hiring such a fantastic crew! We WILL be back.”<br /><br />“Yesterday I visited the museum but had to leave after 20 minutes because my friend who was meeting me there was turned away from a full parking structure. As I was leaving, I saw many availabile spaces and although it was too late for my family and my friends family to enjoy a visit, I assumed your staff would want to know there were plenty of spaces and they were unnecessarily turning visitors away and causing a back up of traffic. Instead, the parking attendant ignored me before shouting at me to move along, and the attendant at the information desk asked me if I wanted to leave a comment. It’s very strange to me that you would have a policy of turning visitors away, especially on a rainy Sunday.”<br /><br />“Hi, I visited the museum with my son today, and have two main comments: 1) We arrived at 14:20 PM, after being stuck in a huge traffic jam for 25 minutes trying to enter the parking lot. The street was jammed with visiting cars coming from both directions. Upon entering I realized that 2 of the 3 lanes were used for exiting cars, even though almost no one was coming out. This is a waste of an entering lane. 2) the museum was super crowded today. I'm not sure about your safety procedure, or any limits. But, this is not the first time that a visit is absolutely insane. People are pushing down hallways (not to mention exhibits), the line to get a cup of coffee is more than a half an hour long, and it seems over crowded (we did notice quite a few buses, so there must have been school visits or the such, but still, as a member I would expect a reasonable experience, which we did not have.”<br /><br />“This is my first time in the museum. The museum and the experience is amazing. 20/10”<br /><br />“I was very disappointed about the new location of the mathematica exhibit. I had to leave and come back a few times due to the lightning shows.”<br /><br />\"First of all, I love the museum, and I think this is the best museum of science I have seen in my life. Howeverm minor thing, the definition of a plasma (as listed in the gift shop) is wrong. Plasma is not just hot, it is also made in a variety of ways. What distinguishes a plasma from other matters (including ionized gas) is the electrical shielding it displays (Debye shielding).”",

Can you please have these surfaces cleaned more often? We sat down for a snack at about 10 AM this morning before most people even use the café was cleared it hadn’t been cleaned since at least the day before.”<br /><br />“It would be nice to create an App for visiting.”<br /><br />“Linda at Omni went 110% out of her way. We were sitting in a bottom row of the theater. She came down all those stairs before and advised us to much better seats. Thank you.”<br /><br />“Omni intro: I love that you kept Leonard Nimoy's voice, but please consider replacing the car crash/police car segment. Without the original video, it's out of context and could be upsetting. Maybe use a shuttle launch or plane overflight?\"<br /><br />“Please play Dave Matthews Experience.”<br /><br />“Question for you: Is the Annual Report recyclable? It’s a weird material, so I’m not sure. If not, even though it’s unusuab and attention-catching, it wasn’t a goodidea!”<br /><br />“I just learned about a chamber music piece by Bruce Adolphe called Tyrannosaurus Sue: A Cretaceous Concerto. Apparently it has been performed around the country. sometimes in conjunction with the actual Sue on tour. Your institution seems like the perfect venue for a performance.”<br /><br />“We are long time members of the museum and enjoy using our reciprocity. We are currently visiting the Orlando Science Center. They have a temporary exhibit called Hall of Heroes. My kids loved it and would love to spend more time exploring this exhibit. We think it would the exhibit. We think it would make a great addition to the MOS at some point in time. Not sure where t direct our suggestion, but hope it finds it way to the right person.”<br /><br />“ My family are members of the museum. I brought my preschooler to the museum today. When we went to use the restroom, the hand dryers were so loud that my child would not go. Is there something that can be done to reduce the<br />noise level? I would like my child to be able to go to the museum without an accident. Thank you.”<br /><br />“The earth is missing! The earth model from the Museum's Community Solar System is no longer at the Sonesta Hotel. Please replace it?”<br /><br />“Me and my Mother had so much fun!”<br /><br />“I have listened to Leonard Nimoy for 40 years in Omni. No one knows who he is anymore. Once he left Boston we never heard from him. Re-do with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who love Boston and keep coming back! Mark Walberg is also<br />more relevant.”<br /><br />“I had an incredible experience watching the particle decay patterns in the cloud chamber. Ted kept me captivated for almost an hour with his incredible knowledge of science history. Thank You!”<br /><br />“In the Solar House exhibit, I think there is a wire loose inside Position A. It often comes up 0,000 but if you hit it, it will give you a reading.”<br /><br />“To MOS: I just participated in the Eversource Mass Energy Workshop for educators on May 31. The program was incredible and I 100% appreciated being at such a great venue as your 6th floor conference room. The hospitality of the<br />staff and the food and beverages provided were great. One thing I was surprised at was that with all the plastic we generated via water bottles and other plastics,<br />there was no recycling available. Everything just went into the trash. Does the MOS not have the ability for recycling? Is it too costly and impractical for the numbers of people you service? Aside from that one question, I want to thank you for for hosting programs for teachers such as the one I attended.”<br /><br />“I drove an hour to get the museum and arrived a mere 5 minutes late to be turned away from the Beyonce live exhibit. I was 5 minutes late because I went to the bathroom. This is one of my favorite museums but I am disappointed with the inflexible policy. This experience has left me feeling negative especially since it is<br />rare that I am available to drive into Boston. #disappointed”<br /><br />“I recently took my class of 23 students to the museum on a field trip. The students thoroughly enjoyed the museum but all staff we encountered could have been more helpful. Everyone we encountered seemed annoyed that they were on \"\"field trip duty\"\" and things like transitioning from our lunch spot back to the museum were confusing (for storage of the coolers we brought) and when we asked, were given comments in rude tones. While I understand that managing groups of children in a museum can be difficult and not everyone's cup of tea, I do have a problem with people not modeling appropriate social conduct in front of my students--if I ask you a question and my students pick up on your rude behavior, how can I defend your actions?v This ranged from check in, to lunch, to asking the info desk questions (to which the info desk was even helpful when we asked were a certain exhibit was in the museum).”<br /><br />“I was disappointed that I drove an hour to arrive a mere 5 minutes late and notable to see the Beyonce experience show. I was slightly late due to the fact that I had to use the bathrooms. I was disappointed with the inflexible policy and now I am not sure if I can make another show. This museum is one of my favorites but this experience has definitely left me feeling negative.”<br /><br />\"Horrified and Offended by Beyonce Experience. 80% of the music was edited but shocked by the words being played.

We anticipate the 4th floor ramp will be back in service by mid-November. <br /><br />While this work will be disruptive, please keep in mind that the Museum garage is a valued amenity for our guests, contract parkers, staff, and volunteers as well as a source of revenue, contributing $3 million to the Museum’s budget annually and we are extremely fortunate that a generous donor contributed to support much needed garage repairs. The work this fall is just the beginning. The next phases of this project will start in the spring with precise timing depending on our New England weather.

As different groups of visitors came and went, one visitor in particular stayed at the Hub for a while and seemed very interested and engaged with the skeletons Dan was talking about. Eventually the visitor moved on and his chaperone came up to the Hub to thank Dan. She was bursting with appreciation for his patience, knowledge, and kindness during the interaction with her student, who she said was part of a group of teens with special learning needs. It was heartwarming and encouraging to hear a very deserving individual receive such incredibly sincere and grateful feedback for something that he enjoys doing, but also does so completely voluntarily.

I quickly popped over to the briefing room to see if anyone was available to answer a few quick questions from the group, and Shubhecchha said she'd be happy to do a Q&amp;A. Instead of just doing a brief and informal meet and greet, Shubhecchha invited the group into the briefing room and led an extremely professional and concise presentation that truly impressed me as well as our distinguished guests. Shubhecchha went way above and beyond to create a warm and welcoming experience for this group (with no time to prepare), and took extreme initiative far beyond what is normally expected from High School interns. Thank you Shubhecchha for your service and leadership!&rdquo;</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">CONGRATULATIONS <strong><span style=\"color: red;\">Debbie Jacob</span>!</strong></span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: red;\">Best Service to Colleagues</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: red;\">Recognized by Annie Petroff on 7/27/2018</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">&ldquo;The museum implemented a credit card updater process to coincide with our one step auto-renewal program. While preparing for our August update, we noticed that a significant number of cards were missing an attribute that was required for the process to work. This attribute needed to be added to over 400 records by the end of the day. Realizing that it was already noon, and there would be no way we could get these done by hand, it became obvious that we would either lose the opportunity to update a significant number of accounts this month, or we would have to work with a delayed schedule which would put too much pressure on DMS to get the memberships processed in time to be mailed to our members. Debbie quickly developed an efficient solution and saved the day - and most likely a significant amount of revenue for the museum.&rdquo;</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: red;\">&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">Getting a MOScar is great feeling, giving a MOScar is an even better one.

While exploring The Human Body, I was compelled to pay particular attention to the capsule exhibit that focused on depression, a condition unfortunately and regularly apparent in my genealogy.  My son, one of my daughters, my brother and I fall into the category and all of us are currently under long-term treatment for this condition. My mother was a long-term patient in the late 60s under treatment for depression.  While I appreciate your recognition of this particular aspect of mental illness, I was disappointed and frankly annoyed by the use of a female model to demonstrate new technologies being developed for the treatment of depression. Having taken note of the three accompanying video testimonies of two women and one gentleman who candidly relate their personal experiences, it's abundantly clear that women dominate the overall picture, thereby perpetuating the notion that depression is a condition largely associated with females. Perhaps the Museum should consider a second look at the promotion of the supposition that women are indeed the weaker sex.  Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.\"<br /><br />\"https://www.mos.org/drop-in-activities/astronomy-after-hours says 'LOCATION: Gilliland Observatory. Find on map'.  But when I click 'Find on map', I don't actually see an observatory anywhere.\"<br /><br />\"Hello! I just wanted to say the presenter on Sunday's Explore the Universe show was amazing. They were very knowledgeable, engaging, and made the day special for my little one. Hope to see another one of their shows soon!\"<br /><br />\"It is outrageous that you would schedule such a misleading program at the Museum of Science, particularly since it is a respected institution attended by many children and adolescents: https://www.mos.org/public-events/killing-cancer-with-cannabis\"<br /><br />\"Hello, I am teacher and visited the museum today with some friends as part of an assignment for me masters in elementary education at Merrimack College. I had asked a group of  employees at the information area if I could have access to the teacher resource area and they told me that it is not open on Saturdays.  I just checked online and it says that it is open on Saturdays from 1-4, we were there from 11:30-3:30. I am unable to come back to complete the assignment but I would like to know why I was lied to about it being open or if the online hours are incorrect? Thank you.\"<br /><br />\"Went to renew our membership as per instructions in the letter received:  http://mos.org/membership     The problem is, there is no evident way to /renew/.  If you cllick on one of the boxes listing membership levels (and you log in as a current member), it says 'you are already a member' and won't put anything in your cart!  Renewal deserves its own button.\"<br /><br />\"Very hard to see what shows are playing at the Planetarium!\"\t<br /><br />\"I had an amazing time in your Museum.  The interactive exhibits were stimulating and prompted the use of logic, reasoning, and questions.Initially I felt that the exhibits looked dated but after walk through the human body section\"<br /><br />\"Recycling is important. Please have more options for recycling paper and utensils. Compostable utensils and a composte bin would be an important addition for MOS.\"\t<br /><br />\"Your 2nd grade Eye Opener Program is the absolute best! It's the only field trip I'd every take my class on in October. Thank you for expanding the minds of Boston's second graders! (no follow up needed)\"<br /><br />\"Very disappointed with the lack of recycling. Whole Foods and most other locations have more comprehensive recycling. And this is the museum of science. Missed opportunity w/composting and incentivizing to keep things sustainable.\"\t<br /><br />\"I was at your food court recently. Your serve ware should all be compostable and the recycle program/instructions should be more visible. Thanks\"<br /><br />\"I was surprised that the section on Alexander Graham Bell makes no mention of Antonio Meucci, whose designs he STOLE. He played a significant role, but much of it, and his credit, is due to Meucci.\"<br /><br />“ Yesterday I attended a show at your planetarium called explore the universe. I just wanted to say how fabulous the presenter was. If I recall correctly, her name was Charity, I may be wrong though. She was so funny and witty, but most importantly engaging. I felt like I was having fun while also learning about space. It was nice to hear about more than our own solar system. Charity had such a unique and relatable perspective. I hope to come back and see her do a show again.”<br /><br /> “I was hoping that you can kindly send me a teacher member card.   I have misplaced my card.  I have been a member for years.”<br /><br />“Signed up with two different emails yet I cannot login in?? I am trying to buy a membership and the process of your website is making it impossible.”<br /><br />“I submitted an email already with no response. I am trying to buy a membership online but when ever i click add to cart it reads cart is empty and my correct account and password does not let me gain access. Please advice.”<br /><br />“I was at the museum on Friday for your teacher partner event. I just wanted to email and say how great of a time myself and my teacher friends had!  The activities were so much fun, the museum had some great exhibits, and the space exhibit was amazing! We really had a great time! Thank you!!”<br /><br />“Please bring back the lightning hand stamp. It was our favorite.”<br /><br />“I brought my grandchildren to the museum on Sunday (10/21). I've been several times in the past 30 years and have always been very happy with what you present. Yesterday's visit was excellent too except for the Mars film in the Omni Theater. It is poorly done and contains far to many corporate references for my liking. The children were bored as was my daughter, wife, and I. The technology is wonderful. It seems as though the Museum of Science could do much better than this. Thank you.”",

While the plastic straw ban has been gaining steam - it is such a drop in the bucket to the amount of waste created by plastics that I was sad to see MOS jump on this ship. Banning straws harms those who rely on them to drink. The world is already set up for able bodied people and I feel like the museum did not consider ability in the banning.  I am only the mother of a toddler who struggles to drink milk from an open cup - and without a straw did spill said milk all over himself at the museum. But this is just minor. Imagine if my child was unable to drink from a cup without a straw.  Now he is being punished.  Think of all the other ways we could reduce plastic, by using compostable silverware and avoiding plastic bottled sodas that are sold at the MOS.”<br /><br />“Please have the ticket counter people know what the Science Now daily topic is and where the Gordon Science presentation center is located.  Thank you.”<br /><br />“Can you please make a Mugar Omni Theater presentation about Mongooses? They have many interesting facts to learn about, especially their immunity to snake venom.”<br /><br />“Loved the Museum and saw as much as I could. My favorite exhibits were the Models for Playing, Learning, Dinosaurs and everything Transportation and NASA.”<br /><br />\"I would pay to see a special show of just Music at the Lightning Exhibit. Perhaps 30 Mins. of AC/DC $15.00 each.”<br /><br />\"Under the 120D Section on the wall in Mathematica Exhibit in Puri, India is wrongfully spelled. It is Jagannath Temple and 'Not' Juggernaut. Please correct the 'distortion!'\"<br /><br />\"I brought my 3 year old son to the museum today and have to say that I am really disappointed with the quality of our visit.  While I understand that construction and repair is a necessary evil, the noise from construction was so disruptive to our visit that neither me nor my toddler could bear to stay in the vicinity.  Meaning that over 2/3rds of the museum was essentially off limits to us.  In addition, multiple displays that are favorites of my son were not functioning including the butterfly exhibit, and various small displays in and around the museum.  While I do understand that this is normal, the museum really should be offering admission at a discounted rate during this time.  It is absurd that I paid over $50 to visit a museum and only be able to visit a small portion of it.  I’d like to ask for my admission to be refunded as our visit today was disappointing.  We live in Boston and have visited the museum before and been really pleased with it, but are really disappointed in today's visit.  Please advise.\"<br /><br />“We've sent several e-mails to your Museum.  We've been consistently ignored. Pretty disappointing considering we have had a membership for almost a decade, never attend, and basically consider our membership a donation to MOS.”<br /><br />\"Exhibit 'World of Maps' - on the image 'Map of a Human Chromosome'<br />The statement actually said that there are 23 chromosomes in every cell. It should say 23 PAIRS of chromosomes (i.e. 46 in all) [except of course for sperm + egg cells] (otherwise the interactive aspects were excellent.)\"<br /><br />\"It would be appreciated if members could receive updates on things like today’s parking garage closure. I drove over an hour to the museum with 2 toddlers. Also the attendants redirecting cars were extremely rude.\"<br /><br />\"Please use metric and imperial units in all displays, especially for temperature.  Your visitors are from many different countries, the majority of which use metric units. So values using Imperial units (especially Fahrenheit) are not understood.  Additionally you are trying to encourage a new generation of scientists and engineers.  To work internationally they will need to understand both systems. Seeing both systems will start a subliminal absorption and understanding of them. The space exhibit was excellent; however, the use of Fahrenheit severely hampered our understanding.  I realize this is a travelling exhibition, please forward my comment to the organizers.\"",

		"messageBody": "After almost 10 years (she will be one day short) Kate Curtis has decided to leave the Museum and accept an HR/Payroll position with the Swampscott School System.   The 5 minute commute and pension were too much for her to turn down.  While it’s sad for us, this is an exciting opportunity for Kate, and I know I speak for all of us wishing her the best of luck. Kate’s last day will be September 21st.<br />             <br />  With any loss comes opportunity and I’m happy to announce that Sarah Hudson has accepted the position as Payroll Coordinator.  This is a great opportunity for Sarah to expand her knowledge and experience within the Accounting department.  It will be a loss for Accounts Payable where she has made many improvements in her short time in that role. Please join me in congratulating Sarah on her new position.  <br />               <br /> With regards to how this will impact the Museum, we will now have two vacant positions, our Cash Accountant position and an Accounts Payable position. We are also in the middle of our new HR/Payroll system implementation that is set to go live January 1st.  Needless to say we have few things happening that will most likely impact most if not all of you. We will continue to try provide the best service possible to everyone, but will have to prioritize work accordingly.  Our top priority will always be paying our employees, then our vendors, then answering requests from our management team/staff.  That being said, there may be times when you may not receive a response as quickly as you have in the past, please be patient.   Hopefully all this change will be invisible to most but it is significant enough we wanted to bring it to everyone’s attention.  If you have questions please let me know.<br /><br />Sincerely, <br />Brian",

Between the hours of 5:00AM-8:30AM, please utilize the Red Wing to access the Blue and Green wings (or Door 16 if coming up from the garage.) We wish to maintain a quiet, mindful library atmosphere for our event participants. A Public Safety officer will be posted in the lobby between these hours, and we will have signage beginning at the Concourse for all those parking in the garage. Following the classes, we have asked C&W to clean the floor in preparation for our 9:00am public opening.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your flexibility and patience. Our last yoga event in March was a huge success, bringing in a new audience to the Museum, and as an employee, it was fun to see something new in action take place in our lobby! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. <br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Gina Crotty, x4475",

		"messageBody": "Asbestos Containing Materials  (ACM) Employee & Building Occupant Notification Letter  October 2018\n\n\nThere is a Training/Informational Session open to any Museum employee or volunteer who wishes to attend: \n              Thursday Nov. 15,  1:00pm-2:00pm, in Hornblower \n\n\nThis mandatory for Museum employees directly affected by the O&M program. If you have previously been required to attend and you did not already receive an invite, please let me know so I can send you the invite.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding ACM, please don’t hesitate to contact me.\n \n\n\nBackground \nAs a durable fire retardant material, asbestos was added to various building components such as ceiling treatments, floor tiles, plaster, fiberboard and insulation. These materials are referred to as asbestos containing materials (ACM).  ACM in good condition does not pose a health risk. When ACM becomes damaged, is disturbed or deteriorates, it can release fibers into the air. If inhaled, asbestos fibers may cause serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The US EPA recommends that ACM be managed in place through periodic inspections and prompt repair when damage is noted.  It must be removed during building demolition/renovation or if significantly damaged.\n\n\nMOS Asbestos Program\nTo minimize exposure of building occupants to asbestos fibers, the Museum of Science has conducted asbestos surveys and implemented an operations and maintenance (O&M) program.  This program identifies areas with known or presumed ACM, outlines procedures to maintain ACM and identifies what to do in the event of damage to ACMs.  The O&M program, which includes locations of known ACMs in Section II, can be found on the Hub Safety page.  An asbestos awareness and other related training programs are also available. \n\nWhat You Need to Know\n•\tPrior to conducting renovations or work that may impact building materials such as insulation, ceiling tiles, flooring, etc., please contact the MOS asbestos coordinator, Christina Dillard cdillard@mos.org  ext. 4249, to determine the presence or absence of ACMs.  Avoid impacting or damaging any known or presumed ACMs.\n\n•\tWork with the asbestos coordinator to provide contractors with asbestos contractor notification forms and returned a signed copy to the asbestos coordinator.  Make sure contractors have also received a copy of the Contractor Health and Safety Program and return the signed acknowledgement to Christina Dillard.\n\n•\tReport damaged ACMs by notifying the asbestos coordinator directly or via ext. 0200.  Do not walk through or otherwise disturb damaged ACM or ACM debris.  If possible, remove any potential sources of air disturbance and isolate the area with signage and barriers.\n\n•\tPlease contact the the MOS asbestos coordinator, Christina Dillard cdillard@mos.org  ext. 4249 with questions you may have regarding the ACM management program or to obtain further information regarding specific locations.\n\n\n\nChristina Dillard | Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) Program Manager \nMuseum of Science  | Facilities Dept.  |  One  Science Park  |  Boston, MA 02114-1099\nP 617-589-4249 | F 617-589-0101 |M 781-789-1178| cdillard@mos.org  |  www.mos.org\n\n\n",

Due to high demand, the Museum also installed three level 1 (low speed) charging stations on the fourth floor and an additional charging station in the basement level of the garage. \n\nMuseum staff, volunteers, interns, contractors and contract parkers are encouraged to utilize both the level 1 and level 2 charging stations. Although vehicles may remain in the level 1 station for the duration of their stay, vehicles must vacate the level 2 stations within 30 minutes completing their charge. ChargePoint will notify an electrical vehicle driver once their vehicle has completed charging. \n\nEffective on Thursday, November 15th, the Museum will begin charging $5.00 per hour after a vehicle has completed charging and the 30 minute grace period has elapsed. In order to avoid this $5 fee per hour, all EV drivers including Museum staff, volunteers, interns, contractor and contract parkers must move their vehicle within 30 minutes. In addition, we require all Museum staff, volunteers and interns to move their car within the 30 minute grace period.",

With help from user-tester extraordinaire Larry Ralph, it has been polished up and is now considered final.  For a given fiscal year, this report goes project by project and shows the expenses charged by line item against each of the funding sources used to fund the project.  The report may be found in the <b>Project and Grant Budget Reports</b> folder in SSRS.<br><br>\n<b><i>Project-Source by FY</i></b> - This report is similar to the preceding one, but instead of showing monthly totals for a single fiscal year, it shows data across all fiscal years since FY15, with one column for each year.  It’s good for looking at longer term projects.  The report may be found in the <b>Summary by Year Reports</b> folder in SSRS.<br><br>\n<b><i>Source-Project by FY</i></b> - This report is identical to the Project-Source by FY, but flips the way the data is organized.  It runs through all your funding sources, then shows the activity on each of the projects that that source has funded.  The report may be found in the <b>Summary by Year Reports</b> folder in SSRS.<br><br>\n(There is another report, <b><i>Actuals by FY</i></b>, in the <b>Summary by Year Reports</b> folder as well.  But it’s still in development, so use it with a grain of salt until you officially hear otherwise.)<br><br>\nNote that each of these reports has drill-down capabilities, in case you need to see the transactions behind any of the summarized totals.<br><br>\nYou should also note that we’ve completely revamped how to wildcard account number information when telling SSRS what you want to see.  This is important if you’ve already been using the system and have grown accustomed to the old underscore wildcarding.  The new version is clearer, easier to keep track of, and better at preventing unwanted data from sneaking into your reports.<br><br>\nFor further information, including info on drilling down and mastering the new wildcarding scheme, please refer to Accounting’s <b><i>All About Finance Reports in SSRS</i></b> document, available on our Hub page.<br><br>\nIT continues to work on developing SSRS reports, and we will keep you posted as more become available.\n",

An issue central across children’s development is how they navigate diverse sources of information, such as testimony from teachers, family or peers, or their own inquiry and evidence.  Kelly’s current research with the Living Laboratory explores the factors that children consider when deciding whether someone is a trustworthy source of information.\n\nThursday 12/6 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)\nLeo Rosenstein – Lab Manager, MIT Language Acquisition Lab\nThe Language Acquisition Lab’s central topic of study is how children learn and acquire their native language(s) – how much of it is biologically determined versus experience-based, how does it change as children mature, and what strategies do children employ in order to extract and use the relevant information in language experiences? Members of the lab are currently studying how children learn the rules of grammar, and how their use of these rules changes as they grow. \n\nSaturday 12/8 at 9:30 (Classroom A)\nPeggy Li – Research Fellow, Harvard University Laboratory for Developmental Studies\nThe Laboratory for Developmental Studies represents a multidisciplinary group of researchers interested in discovering more about the way infants and young children learn about the world that surrounds them. Dr. Li’s research primarily focuses on the relationship between children’s language and cognitive development, and how they both may rely on and grow from one another. Currently in Living Laboratory, she is investigating the role language plays in the creation of new representational structures and concepts for children.\n\nSaturday 12/8 at 12:30 (Upper Morse)\nAmanda Haber – Doctoral Student, Boston University Social Learning Lab\nThe Social Learning Laboratory’s research focuses on children’s use of social and cognitive information when learning about the world. An issue central across children’s development is how they navigate diverse sources of information, such as testimony from teachers, family or peers, or their own inquiry and evidence.  Amanda’s current Living Laboratory research investigates how children’s exploration of a new concept is influenced by the type of information they receive about it.\n\nSunday 12/9 at 9:30 (Hornblower)\nRebecca Peretz-Lange – Doctoral Student, Tufts University Cognitive Development Lab\nThe Cognitive Development Lab’s goal is to better understand how children learn about the physical and social world – about the objects they play with, the people they learn from, and how both interact in their everyday life.  Much of the lab’s research focuses on how children learn about cause and effect.  Rebecca’s current Living Lab research investigates how children reason about other people’s behaviors.\n\nMonday 12/10 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)\nVishakha Agrawal – Lab Manager, Northeastern University Communication Development Lab\nThe Communication Development Lab investigates perceptual and cognitive development in human infants and young children to gain new insights into the development of multisensory communication skills.

Dr. Blake’s current Living Laboratory research investigates children’s perceptions of fairness.\n\nFriday 12/14 at 12:30 (Hornblower)\nSona Kumar – Doctoral Student, Boston University Social Learning Lab\nThe Social Learning Laboratory’s research focuses on children’s use of social and cognitive information when learning about the world. An issue central across children’s development is how they navigate diverse sources of information, such as testimony from teachers, family or peers, or their own inquiry and evidence.

We were taken back when we found your letter with the four free passes to the Museum of Science.  Your kindness has warmed my heart, truly appreciative of your kind gesture and we will definitely take some time to enjoy the Museum with our kids.  Thank you”\n\n“We attended an event there and enjoyed the evening until we attempted to leave. As visitors to Boston we were unaware that cokes could not be consumed on the street. A person snatched them from my husband’s hands and walked away with them.  All the way my husband is saying that we will drink the coke inside before leaving and asking for them back. They sat them on a table and just said it’s against the law.  I saw them snatch an empty cup from an older lady just outside the door very rudely as well.  If they had stood at the door explaining that cups couldn’t be taken out, we would have gladly complied.  I am sure that you will want to address this situation because rudeness to a guest should never be tolerated.”.\n\n“Hello, I visited the museum. Myself , son and  grandchildren used a library pass  to get in . Even with this it costs $40.00 .this seems like a lot for a family making  45,000.00 with no paid vacation , no retirement  and using Mass health. Yes they too much for no EBT befits  so have to pay . Seems wrong . In  addition you over heat the place so one has to carry costs or pay more .this was my 73 th birthday gift   .Kids wanted some to eat and again the prices are high. Also we had to leave an  information movie as a parent left their kid that had some  problem and  it was play their iPhone with a high volume .You need more floor people so they ask problem kids even if they have learning problems to be respectful. only time I saw a floor person was when they were asking people to leave about 10 minutes  before closing . The bad reviews you get seem to be right on. even the MFA has free coat check and people are not so active  .  your adds should be ' the museum  for rich family's only ' or 'pay more or be left out '  $4.50 for a bottle of water and  butterfly exhibit  are extra costs more and more .We took the train and  walking the unfriendly street to north station . Were you left out of the green way?\"\n\n\"Your website has no dates for Omni programs . How can I plan ahead ? Poorly designed.\"\t\t\n\n\"It was disappointing when we went to the IMAX theater only to be followed by your employee ticket clerk. Guess they wanted to see something happen in the seats and sat a few rows behind us. Please stop the stalking by your employees. Thank you.\"\t\n\n\"I would be very happy if there was a exhibit about rockets.\"\t\t\n\n\"School groups are very loud and disruptive. We did not enjoy the planetarium show we paid to see as a result.\"\n\n\"A couple of months ago I brought my granddaughter to the museum, and she met a gentleman volunteer who was demonstrating the Theremin, a musical instrument I had never before seen. The volunteer, I don't remember his name, was so kind, spending a lot of time enthusiastically talking with my granddaughter about music. He inspired her to take up the piano, and now she is one hundred percent involved in music. Her outlook on life is also much more positive, which I attribute to her love of music. Her encounter at your museum and the caring support she got from your volunteer was so precious! That brief encounter changed her life. We came to the museum two other times but did not see him. Can you please relay to him our gratitude. He's a distinguished, tall, 60-year-old with a beard.\"\n\n\"Visited the Museum.  Had lunch. Ordered a 12 inch sandwich and two sides. Staff cut a 3 inch sandwich and gave us two sides.   This was the cut sandwich.   Not what I ordered. Explained this to the staff member and they said this is what they were told to give when the twelve inch was ordered. What is so hard about sending the proper food that was ordered.   Got a membership and this was not a good first impression of the staff or facility.\"\n\n\"We received our Sparks! newsletter this weekend and my son, age 2, was delighted to see the article about the trains. He was so excited we went to the museum the next day. However, the exhibit is not, contrary to the final paragraph of the story, here \"\"right now.\"\" It doesn't open until 11/18. I suppose I could have checked that on your website but it didn't occur to me that I would need to do so.\"\n\n\"I'm confused.... your email solicitation invites me to renew membership, and link it, and set up auto renewals for a 10% discount..... and when I complete all the forms, no where is there a renewal option!\"\n\n\"Grant in the skeleton exhibit taught us so much! What an amazing volunteer. Thank you, Grant!\"\n\n\"Capitalize on the slime craze! Create a hands on exhibit for the overnights next summer. Teach on polymers + chemical reactions! My husband is a chemist and has explained the process to our kids...\"\n\n\"Terrible exp! My family (wife and 4 year old) were at the space area of the museum. A very rude staff member came to us yelling while we were trying to take a last picture. They stood in front of my wife with a terrible attitude. \n\n\"At the thanksgiving season, I would like to extend my thankfulness to your staff, Patrick, for his great help to me.  I got a flat tire on October 4th when driving out of the garage from the parking.  It is very cold and dark at that evening and I totally have no experience in dealing with such situation.  I appreciated that Patrick offered me help and eventually was home safely.\"\n\n\"I spent the night at the museum with my daughter. We frequent the museum, particularly the planetarium. We went to the planetarium program in the morning with our troops and I was so delighted to see that our favorite presenter was doing the show! We have seen her do many shows and it is always a treat. As always she did great and I hope to see her do another show when we return.\"\n\n\"On a recent visit, I had an incident with one of your employees and would like to provide feedback by sending an email directly to the appropriate supervisor in customer service or personnel. Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.\"\n\n\"What happened to the Nano Brothers shows? They were the highlight of our visits, and the reason that we keep renewing our membership. Please bring them back as a weekly feature!\"\n\n\"Enjoyed a trip to the Museum this weekend. However the exhibit on energy / power generation is hopelessly out of date. One graph from 2007 shows U.S. power generation coming from nearly 50% coal...a statistic that is 11 years out of date. Another sign lists coal energy as the cheapest form when in reality solar, wind, and natural gas are all cheaper than coal, see for example https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2018/. The display is highly misleading and must be updated -- especially given the Museum's public commitment to renewable energy. Thanks.\"\n\n\"I was at the museum and I think I noticed an error at the bird exhibit. The sign for Barn Owl says its endangered in connecticut and rhode island but the picture of the states below it has massachusetts and rhode island colored in.\"\n\n\"I was hoping that you can kindly send me a teacher member card.   I have misplaced my card.  I have been a member for years.\"\n\n\"I have been trying to renew a premier5 memberships as a gift with the 20% off Vybet Monday discount.\"\n\n\"There are stickers on the doors that say 'conserve energy' Why is there such a wide gap at the doors? Fix this please!!! The staff must get cold in the lobby.\"\n\n\"1) lack of any environmental messaging was surprising and disappointing.\n2) all disposable dishware also surprising and disappointing\"\n\n\"There used to be footprints on either side of the Boston/Cambridge split in the lobby, you could put them on the upper walkway.\"\n\n\"Dear Museum Staff,\nOur yearly 8th Grade field trip to the MOS continues to be one of the experiential and academic highlights for our students. The MOS support is deeply appreciated by the students, parents, and staff at our school.\"\n\n\"I took my 10 yesr old son to the museum todAy when he had a day off from school. We were both excited for him to see “Rocky Mountain Express”  in the Omni Theater. We ended up leaving during the introduction, however, since he found the “sound check” noises, particularly what sounded like a violent car crash, to be terrifying. Target age is listed as grade 3-12, however, this sound was quite traumatic, and should be eliminated. Thank you from a longtime MOS member\"\n\n\"I was a member for one year.  I am no longer a member.  I am very annoyed that I cannot EASILY unsubscribe from your email. Today I spent and inordinate amount of time going all over your web site looking for unsubscribbel  Under email I found out it was easy to unsubscribbe.  I thought it was a law that all emails must have a means to unsubscribe. I would like this email to go to the board, the webmaster, and the chief administrator.  I find this problem absolutely rude from such a large technologically advanced organization.  I expect no more emails, an at a minimum an unsubcribe link in the next email.  An apology from the museum would show good manners\"\n\n\"I work  with the Arc of the South Shore. We had a great time at the Musuem on Friday. The staff gave us the discounted passes plus he was very informative. Also the staff at the animal exhibit was very nice and a very good instructor.i was wondering if you have instructors come to schools or organizations.  Thank you so much I oil forward from hearing from y\n",

		"messageBody": "December 1, 2018-December 31, 2018\n\n“Just wanted to let you know that instructors in the Human Life wing yesterday (Mary for taste testing w/cotton swabs and Jenn for cleaning animal heart and lung) were great!!  They captivated our group of 3-7 year olds.  So instructive, so caring, so compelling.  Great job MoS!”\n\n“I was reading about your Pink Floyd Laser Show but it was really difficult to find out 1; In what country you are located 2: Where in this country you are 3: I still haven't found out where in Boston you are located as the map only shows the intrerior of the museum.”\n\n“For 30 years MOS had the best Mac n cheese in town. Now the new “ recipe” is extremely disappointing. Bring back the best Macy n Christmas in Boston.”\n\n“My son and I had a great day today at the museum. I was especially impressed with an employee named Grant (I think) who was working bone exhibit on the 2nd floor. He spent a lot of time speaking with and teaching my son all about bones. “\n\n“Went into the Mars presentation. Staff talking during the movie....whole presentation.”\n\n“Elizabeth is extraordinary and a very nice valued worker. She made my visit above and beyond.”\n\n“Reinstate the Solar System Model!! I love the planets at Riverside and South Station and would love to go find all of the others around Boston! (in T-Stations and otherwise)”\n\n“We had the most pleasant experience because of an above and beyond customer service rep. named Jasmine. This place will be one to come back to because of her service.”\n\n“Train scene too high and snow too high for kids and adults. S/B separate table--less tunnel also.”\n\n“I signed up for membership almost two weeks now. Yet, I didn't receive membership card or even a letter from Museum of Science. When should I expect to receive them?”\n\n“Bring back the molasses gingerbread cookies in the cafe! Chocolate chip is good, but the variety is nice and that was my favorite one.”\n\n\"The hands on exhibit was fun but there should be more items.\"\n\n\"Interesting, fun to learn. More signage of lab hours in main entrance.\"\n\n\"To whom it may concern,  I wanted to reach out in regards to my recent visit to the Museum of Science. I brought my boyfriend to see the Train Exhibit as a Christmas gift as he is a big collector and hobbyist and I had heard it advertised on the radio and saw the billboard for it as well. While we enjoyed visiting the rest of the museum, I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the train exhibit. It is presented as this great learning experience with lots to partake in and see yet was essentially just a small corner of the museum with a large train track in the middle of it. Needless to say my boyfriend was very disappointed in his experience as well. The Museum of Science is held in high regard and its customers pay good money to visit and it would be my thought that if you advertised for a grand exhibit with lots of potential, you would get what you paid for; however, in this instance that was not the case. I just wanted to bring this to someone's attention as I feel I did not get what I paid for and was greatly disappointed and would hope that in the future the museum's advertisements would hold true to their exhibits. Thank you so much for your time. “\n\n\"In the minerals exhibit, amber is included as a mineral. Amber is not a mineral. There's a fossils exhibit 5 feet away! (Well, not technically a fossil either w/o any bugs.)\"\n\n\"I like trains a lot, and I like you to invent some more trains.\"\n\n\"I love the train exhibit. The scenes are very well done and really pretty to look at. The top is so high however that children can't see. A set of steps or bleechers around the perimeter of the room would be great so kids can step up high to admire the top.\"\n\n\"This science lab was a wonderful hands on experience. Thank you!\"\n\n\"We found the film 'Destination Mars' to be a great disappointment w/ no real explantation of the dementions, boring colors - unhuman. We are used to better.\"\n\n\"I have to say how disappointing it was taking my kids here. They didn’t even like it 95 buck including parking what a rip off\"\n\n\"Hello,  We recently bought a family membership.  Three of our daughter's are blind.  We are really disappointed!  Very few of the exhibits are truly blind friendly and certainly didn't engage our girls.  We would really like a refund.  We may consider becoming members at a future date if you engage new exhibits that are truly friendly to those who are blind and have special needs.  Thank you.\"\n\n\"I recently went to a Planetarium music show featuring Radiohead. I hadn't been to one in years, so long, in fact, that I asked for tickets to a laser show. My wife and I were wondering and hoping that someday you might have a Coldplay show in the Planetarium.\"\n\n\"The trains exhibit you've been promoting was very disappointing. My mother and I made the trip to the museum specifically for it, only to find it to be a rudimentary display of running trains. The top level train had clearly come undone at some point and the engine was pushing the car. The trains that were running didn't seem to have any connection to Boston or New England (even I have a T commuter rail train I could have lent you) aside from a few structures to represent Boston. There were no displays on how trains work, steam or diesel. There was nothing on the science or engineering behind railroads or important railroad landmarks. The year-round layout at Charles Ro Supply in Malden is far better and equally educational. The only positive note I have is about the gentleman explaining the different scales of model trains to people. You could have done a lot more with the history of model trains. I think for the amount of advertising you did for the exhibit, it was terribly weak and hugely disappointing. You could have at least connected with the NMRA Hub group or the local n-trak organization. Or even the New England Lego users group. I spent a lot of money to come to the museum for a lot of nothing.\"\n\n\"It would be very helpful if you would post holiday hours on website.  I'll call later today to see if you are open Dec 31 and/or Jan 01 and if so, what the hours are.\"\n\n\"We were truly disappointed by the All Aboard! train exhibit.  When I write \"\"we,\"\" I refer collectively to our family, including two boys, ages 9 and 12, two middle-aged parents, and two grandparents in their 70's.  We had encouraged our children's grandfather, a model train aficionado, to come to town to see the exhibit with us after seeing a promotional billboard over Route 90.  Our conclusion: the actual exhibit is hardly \"\"billboard worthy.\"\"  While it nodded to an explanation of perspective and scale, we found little in the exhibit overall that related much to science.\"\n\n\"We came for the train exhibit but it was very lacking would've liked more science behind trains etc... we see more @ free train shows then here very disappointing\"\n\n\"Jeremy S. smiled at us at 10:15 and was very helpful 4 1/2 hours later... I saw him responding to a group of people in the same manner. He's great!\"\n\n\"All Aboard\nThis is a great exhibit for MOS to display. It builds connections with local organization and inter generational interactions. I liked all the 'hidden' details (Waldo, unicorn, reindeer, etc). Would add an ice scullpture to Frog Pond. Liked the snow on the roof and different types of trees. The perspective on the size of trees is well done. Really enjoyed this exhibit.\"\n\n\"My boyfriend loves trains and we had a really great time. Thank you :)\"\n\n\"The train exhibit would have been amazing if you had an 'I spy' feature for the kids.\"\n\n\"None of the hand sanitizer dispensers worked in the museum!\"\n\n\"Bought gift membership - we had a wonderful time.\"\n\n\"Love your teenage teachers! Great with little kids!\"\n\n\"There was not one hand sanitizer station that worked in the entire museum!\"\n\n\"'Hose threw water' was in Quick as a Wink. Was that in intentional 'threw'? Or was it supposed to be 'through'?\"\n\n\"This exhibit is great. My 7 yr old son had so much fun looking at the train models & finding surprises. Making models was the best part.\"\n\n“I visited on 12/31 and wanted to share my feedback about the restaurant experience in the hopes that things can be improved for other guests. The day was busy as you would expect for a vacation/holiday period. Unfortunately, the restaurant was not prepared for the influx of capacity crowds during lunch. There were not enough employees working to provide service for the amount of customers present. It led to long lines of people waiting. We waited in long lines for food, especially at the grill where the four employees I could see could not keep up with the demand. The food was gone as fast as it was prepared. Additionally, there were 6 register stations, but only 2 were staffed. This makes no sense to me. Obviously, the reason to have 6 registers was in anticipation of large crowds, but why then would you not staff them at the busiest times of the busiest days. The result was long lines of people with hungry and impatient children standing in lines holding trays of food that was getting cold. Further, the soda machines were busy, which resulted in the machines running out of ice and various sodas, and also ketchup, napkins etc. ran out. There were no available employees to replace these items as they were depleted.  The end result of all of this lack of staffing and preparation was a poor dining experience for customers. People coming to the museum expect the prices to be high and the quality of the food to suffer due to mass production, but to have to wait and wait as well is too much for families with small children. These concerns can be rectified with more staffing during the busy lunch hours and better preparation for large crowds. Thank you.”\n\n\"Can you please send me more information about your policy for admission of MIT students\nto the museum of science?\nI am currently a graduate student at MIT, and both as an undergraduate earlier, and now as a graduate student I've enjoyed showing the MoS to my visitors with kids to excite them about STEM for the last 9 years.  Yet, I was denied entry yesterday since apparently I no longer look like an undergraduate :)\nI verified today with our activities committee (MITAC) and libraries staff assured me that a valid student MIT id is all that is needed (there is no pass like your desk member recommended).\nAs far as I know we have been contributing to the Museum of Science, both with money coming from my student tuition, and with volunteering and joint projects.  Our department regularly keeps our award ceremonies at the MoS, and I even attended my graduate student friends wedding there (apparently MoS was a special place to them as well).”\n",

		"messageSubject": "More Accounting Reports in SSRS",
		"messageBody": "Accounting and IT are happy to announce the deployment of several more major reports to the SSRS reporting system:\n\nFirst, the <b><i>Actuals by FY</i></b> report in the <b>Summary by Year Reports</b> folder, previously announced as available but still in development, is now considered finished and ready for prime time.\n\nOther new reports include two reports under <b>Department Budget Reports</b>:\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;\"><b><i>Department Income and Expense</b></i> - This is the same as the pdf budget report managers currently get e-mailed each month.  We’ll continue to send those out as a final “official” version once the books are closed for the month, but in the meantime, you can now run this yourself if there’s anything you want to check on before the monthly numbers are finalized.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;\"><b><i>Department Spread by Month</b></i> - Another budget vs. actual report, but with a separate column for each month.  Note that this report shows <u>only</u> your general operating budget (no grants or endowments).</p>\nNote that these reports speak Accounting-ese: income is reported as <u>negative</u> (credit) numbers.  Don’t worry; you’ll get used to it.\n\nAnd finally, there are two new reports under <b>General Inquiries</b>:\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;\"><b><i>Vendor Inquiry</b></i> - Shows invoices and credit memos processed by Accounts Payable.  Organized by Vendor, then Invoice.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;\"><b><i>Vendor Inquiry by Check</b></i> - The same information as above, but clumped by check.</p>\nNote that while other SSRS reports have data going back several years, since we just started entering invoices directly into the new Accounting system on 11/1/2017, that’s as far back as the Vendor reports will go.  If you have questions about invoices/payments earlier than that, e-mail Accounting.\n\nWith the deployment of these reports, we have now reproduced most of the functionality you used to enjoy (well, not enjoy, but at least had) with Crystal.  There are still a couple of specialized reports we have yet to push out, but what’s now available is a pretty complete manager toolkit for looking at your financial data.\n\nAs always, check out the <b><i>All About Finance Reports in SSRS</b></i> document on Accounting’s Hub page for further info on using this system.\n",

		"messageSubject": "MOS Wireless Site Survey January 28-30, 2019",
		"messageBody": "This spring Information Technology will be redesigning and refreshing the Museum’s wireless network.  The goal of this effort is twofold: 1) to update our infrastructure to bring us into compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) requirements, and 2) to support a greater number of devices and increase application performance throughout the building, for both staff and visitors alike.\n\nThis work will span several weeks as IT and our partner vendors work our way through the entire facility installing new equipment.  In order to determine the best place for access points and other equipment such as cables and wiring, a site survey will be required as a first step.  This will also help identify what type of equipment is needed and how it needs to be installed.\n\nIT will be conducting the onsite survey the week of January 28th and we expect it to take 2-3 days to complete.  It will require that we bring contractors and their survey equipment into office and exhibit hall spaces during business hours, when the wireless is in use.  IT plans to survey the offices on floors 4-6 on Monday, and then move to the Gordon Wing, lower floors and exhibit halls on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nThe survey work should have no impact on your ability to do your job.  We anticipate minimal disruption, if any, to normal business activities or the visitor experience.  There will be no disruption of network services during this time.\n\nWhat Do I Do If I have Concerns?\nIf you have concerns regarding the survey, or have questions or need assistance, please contact the IT Help Desk at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130. \n",

I am also a Master of Divinity candidate at Boston University School of Theology, where I am currently completing my contextual field education at Safe Havens Interfaith Partnership Against Domestic Violence and Elder Abuse. My work there centers on the intersection of spirituality, sexuality, and violence. \n\nMy end goal is to create a resource for faith and ethical leaders that will set necessary guidelines on how to appropriately, compassionately, and in a way that is identity affirming provide spiritual and pastoral care to survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence who are LGBTQ+. This is a significant undertaking that has been met with overwhelming interest and support. To this end, I would like to share a flyer for upcoming listening sessions I will be having with survivors who identify as LGBTQ+ in the hopes that more and more word will get out. The more participants who attend these, the better, as no one person's experience is the same. \n\nHopefully these issues haven't impacted you personally, but maybe you attend a place of worship or are involved in a community where someone could benefit from sharing their experiences in a safe and non judgemental way.

		"messageBody": "Comment Cards January 1, 2019-January 31, 2019\n\n\"Hello, and my apologies for the previous interrupted comment. This comment form submits the comment as soon as you press Enter. I'd like to draw your attention to non-scientific wording in the New England Habitats exhibit in the Green Wing of the museum. As you can see in the pictures linked below, the panel for every species says, '[the species] are built for survival'. This is teleological wording that ignores science, misinforms the public, and suggests that the MOS adheres to creationism. Please correct these displays to something like 'how [animals] are adapted to their environment' or 'how [animals] have evolved to adapt to their environment.' Thank you. https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZjUEM2gQCYhwLaoc7\"\n\n\"My husband and son were there last week and my son left his water bottle next to the photo booth. I was sure it would be at Lost & Found went I went to retrieve it today. I was informed by the gentleman at the Info Booth that all things 'food related' are thrown out at the end of each day. A reusable Nalgene water bottle labeled with the child's name? Really?? Conservation is promoted throughout the building, starting at the front door. This policy of throwing away a child's water bottle without giving his parent any time at all to come for it is in direct opposition to your conservation efforts. I highly recommend you amend this policy.\"\n\n\"My 6yr old son's favorite spot in the museum has always been the hallway of moveable gears and pulleys (lower level, blue wing). He's a beginner reader, so he's noticing words more and today he noticed that several of the machines were missing their labels. I'm sure that it's not a priority, but we would love to see that area freshened up and missing labels re-painted. Thank you very much!\"\n\n\"I was at the museum today, to view the new trains exhibit. It was fantastic! Trains have been part of my life for over 60 years. It's so encouraging to see that the museum is promoting our great hobby! Unfortunately the average of model railroaders is around 65 so we need all the help we can get!\"\n\n\"Is the David Bowie Experience only at 7:30 in the evening?  What about those of us who grew up with his music but can no longer drive at night?  I live in Kittery and getting to the Museum for 7:30 and then making it home is a real hardship.  Thank you\"\n\n\"In the Hall of Human Life, the Do you looked scared link station is not recording data correctly.\"\n\n\"Am I missing it on your webpage or is there no membership opportunity as a singleton?\"\n\n\"I was at the museum, one show i saw was the polar Express in 4d and i was not happy with it as it was not what i thought it would be for 4d i am not happy about it.\"\n\n\"I do not know why my membership did not auto-renew.\"\n\n\"Hi, I am a basic member and attended the Volcanos Imax today. The movie was very good. When I went to pay for the parking, the machine did not acknowledge my membership card and there for did not get the 2 hour discount. We were not there more than 2 hours but were still charged $13.00 on my credit card.\"\n\n\"After ordering tickets and being told that my membership would be applied at checkout the website proceeded to charge my card. Now I'm on eternal hold to try and get this charge off...\"\n\n\"I also still haven't received my membership cards (and got the membership sometime before Christmas)\"\n\"Your Wardsboro Panther display reads that the last 'cougar' killed in New England was killed in 1881.  This information might be correct if you had said 'last Eastern cougar' ... 130 years later, a cougar was struck and killed on the Wilbur Cross Pkwy in Connecticut. DNA showed that this animal came from Black Hills, S.D.  \nThe last 'cougar' killed  part of your display should properly reflect the correct feline on display, an (Eastern) cougar.\"\n\n\"I'm a local MOS lover and have been visiting the museum all my life. Yesterday, I spent the afternoon at MOS with my family. I happened to walk by a staff member who was giving a presentation on the top science stories of 2018. He did a wonderful job and I really enjoyed it! However, what I'd most like to remark upon was what it meant to me to hear him introduce himself with his pronouns in that setting. I am a non-binary person who uses they/them/theirs pronouns. It is often so hard to get even my own family to be respectful of my pronouns and gender identity. To see a MOS staff member in a professional, science-based, and highly visible setting introduce himself with his pronouns really made me feel valid. It made me want to come back even more, and to bring friends who are not always treated with respect for their identities. It was particularly meaningful that this staff member included his pronouns despite their not contradicting the assumptions audience members may have made about him—that is to say, he appeared to be cis-gendered but included pronouns anyway, sending the super duper important message that this is for everyone, not just trans folks. Thank you all so, so much. I hope that you will please let the staff member know how much his words meant to me, and that MOS will continue to be a leader for social justice. Whether you know it or not, we see the large and small ways you seek to support marginalized communities and they mean everything to us. Truly, thank you.\"\n\n\"TWIMC, I apologize for the formatting, but your platform does not allow for me to hit the 'return' button on mobile (as I've now learned twice). I hope, despite this inconvenience, this message is received and taken seriously.  Besides fixing that issue (allowing people to hit 'return/enter' on mobile to improve formatting as well as changing formatting to automatically  create new 'lines' instead of typing them all in a single stream of text. As I attempt to navigate this, I am reminded there is an email I can reply to for more immediate service. Despite the fact I don't require immediate feedback, I'll opt out of this as it seems barely navigable. Please ask a higher-up to try to utilize this. It's ridiculous.\" \n\n\"Had a great time. Your staff was very helpful & supportive of my disabled parent. It's great that you offer scooters free of charge.\n\nSuggestion - sell petware/clothing in souvenir shop.\"\n\n\"All Aboard:  Best thing I've ever seen!\"\n\n\"Please put a tip box in the restrooms, like you have @ the coat check. Bathroom staff work very hard and are very friendly and gracious.\"\n\n\"I know this isn't PC, but we will not be taking our family any more to an institution that welcomes this group https://www.facebook.com/theslaughterhousesociety/ according to this article: https://www.boston.com/culture/events/2019/01/14/museum-of-science-drag-king-show-to-planetarium-valentines-day \n\n\"Hi! Please remove me from your mailing lists. I love the MOS, but I don't like to receive mail. \nThank you!\"\n\n\"I am very annoyed by my visit to your cafeteria. My wife tried getting a cup for tap water (which is supposed to be free) and they literally gave us the equivalent of a shot glass and wouldn't give us another shot glass or a bigger cup. This is an absolute joke. Just because we dont want to drink soda doesnt mean we should get cups equivalent to a sip of water. You are the museum of science, you should be encouraging people to drink water not soda. The employees not giving us a reasonable cup for tap water really spoiled my trip and we will not be returning to the museum of science because of it, we will just explore nature instead. I don't return to places that treat their custoners so poorly, you should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"Hi, I'd love to be able to access my member card on my phone by logging into the website or a mobile app, so that I don't need to carry the physical card. Any plans to do that?\nShameless plug: I work for a company specializing in building web and mobile apps, would love to help if we can.\nThanks!\" \n\n\"Wondering why the 5 person family membership only comes with 4 passes for each thing? We have 5 people in our family ages 7-41, so they all need tickets, but in order for us to go to anything, we have to purchase one additional ticket. It is frustrating to have to pay for another ticket. Wouldn't it make sense to offer a regular 2 person membership and then \"\"add a person\"\" option for the membership extras? Or just put 5 tickets each on the 5 person membership? Just curious why you have it set up like that. Thanks\"\n\n\"the amount of stations are wonderful, I thoroughly liked the chemistry.\"\t\t\t\t\n\n\"It was cool and I liked it. :) Awsome!!!!\"\n\n\"We came to see the trains that came from the cardiac waiting room @ Boston Children's Hospital. We were told that they are not currently on display. We would like to know if they'll be coming back. My son is very disappointed & searching for it.\"\n\n\"Thrill ride Kim was the Best.\"\n\n\"I am a little upset about your renewal policy. I got a renew notice in the mail and I decided to renew on-line. When I completed the renewal it said that my membership was only until 1/31/2020. My current membership ends 3/31/2019. That means my membership is only for 10 months. In the past I have renewed by mail and the new membership has been added at the end of the current membership which would have been 3/31/2020. I guess I will have make sure that I renew during the month my membership expires so I get a full 12 months.\" \n\n\"We have been a member at museum of science for years and really enjoy Discover Center.

Really? What does this have to do with science. THIS IS WHY I WILL NOT BE RENEWING MY FAMILY MEMBERSHIP.\"\n\n\"I am most interested is watching the IMAX movie 'Superpower Dogs' yet the current listing indicates that no theater in New England plans on airing it.  Please consider adding this movie to you future listings.\"\n\n\"Your reset password 'change password' button does not work after receiving the link to reset.\" \n\"There is a broken “Exhibit” link. I noticed this by clickkng on Exhibits from the Valentines via an iPhone.\nhttps://www.mos.org/exhibits/chocolate\"\n\n\"I am wondering if the women of gastropod will be returning to the mos any time soon? And, can yall have Tracy and Holly from Stuff You Missed in History Class too???  PLEASE.\"\n\n\"How do I change the names on the membership account? Why not possible online? Thanks.\"\n\n\"Hi there. I bought tickets for the David Bowie experience last weekend, which I was super excited for. When I arrived at 7:33, three minutes late, we we're locked out. \nI was never informed that I would be locked out. The lady at the desk said it said so when I purchased my ticket but that information was not included. I saw the event through Facebook and bought them through the link provided there. \nNow you're sold out this weekend and I missed an awesome opportunity due to lack of communication on your part. \nI wanted to let you know that there were many others waiting in line with me for their refund. \nThank you for your time on the matter. \"\n\n\"Recently I visited the museum for 3-4 hours. I paid for parking, but did not receive a receipt. At the parking gate my ticket was not recognized (so I had to back up and get in another lane) and I was charged the full day's rate. I'm requesting a refund on that last charge only. I can send documentation by email. Thank you.\"\n\n\"In the Charles River exhibit there is a sign showing how land was filled to increase the size of  Boston and Cambridge , But it doesn’t say where the dirt came from\"\n\n\"Many years ago when I was a kid I remember two things that are no longer at the museum: a huge steam engine out front and a boat’s bridge that might have been where the discovery center is now. It would be nice to see the boat bridge return and to see something telling about the steam engine. \nAlso, it would be nice to see the steam engine in the basement of the blue wing moving\"\n\n\"Hi,\nI'm very interested in how you process and apply information to exhibits in the Planetarium!!\nI work in Clinical Pharmacy so I'm curious how those in other scientific fields apply literature and information\nPlease reach out, I'd Love to discuss more!\"\n\n\"I am writing to let you know about a disappointing experience I had with two staff members.  \nThe employees were engaged in a conversation for the entire time we were present, and appeared to be annoyed when people engaged them to ask questions.  While engrossed in their conversation, they also were standing in the way of one of the benches. This experience was so uncharacteristic of my typically positive encounters at the MoS that I wanted to share this feedback.\"\n\n\"Hello,  Please pass this note onto Terry in Live Presentations. I had the pleasure meeting Terry yesterday at the Lightning demonstration and told him of its online video.  A phenomenal show!\"\t\n\n\"Cafe food is going downhill.  Three days straight no fish and chips. Got chicken fingers and fries today because no fish again - horrible- fries were cold, chicken tasted it’s been sitting in grease for a while. What a wasted lunch break, and wasted $, couldn’t eat half of it. Please get better food quality and cooks\"\t\t\n\n\"Cafeteria VERY dirty unpleasant\"\n\n\"Thanks for yesterday's visit. My family always enjoys the MoS. Yesterday's hit was 'Superheros' exhibit, esp. the tardigrade and the various deep-diving mammals. The butterflies are always a tonic in the middle of winter. \nI think there is an error in the activity \"\"Mapping the Coast\"\" in the \"\"Making Models\"\" sections. In this activity, the guest looks through a window at a slow rotating island, and is asked to create map the coastline. There are 4 signs posted on the island, one for each of the cardinal compass directions. After the guest is satisfied with their effort, they lift a flap to view the right answer. \nAs a sailor (and driver in Boston), I'm used correlating what I see with what's on the map. It's a good skill to have and I'm glad to see an exhibit showcasing it.\nThe problem is that the right answer is not presented with North-is-Up orientation.  To see this, look for the single deep narrow bay.  On the model, it occurs in the NW quadrant of the island. On the answer-map, it occurs just south of west, say 255°. It's about 80° off. That's frustrating.\nI hope you find the above explanation cogent. If I'm mistaken and there's really no error after all, I'd love to be corrected.\"\n\n\"I visited the MofS today with my family and especially loved the Superpowers Exhibit and the Wild Kratts exhibit, specifically with their common theme of deep ocean ecosystems.  In the future I would love to further explore the process of chemosythesis and the symbiotic relationship that exists within giant tube worms.  Lastly, the Art and Nature exhibit I visited last month was so incredible, and underrated.  Each pull of a drawer was breathtaking, and I’d love to learn more about mordern art in nature collections.  Thanks for your time.  Best wishes!!!\"\n\n\"Good morning,\nYesterday my family and I had taken a trip to the MOS which we had done many times when our children were younger. When purchasing our tickets to the exhibit hall I had inquired about any benefits for military/veterans. The cashier asked for an ID which mine had started I was retired. I was told there is nothing offered for Veterans only active Military Members. I wouldn’t be writing this today if I hadn’t noticed on your website that you offer FREE admission to the exhibit hall for EBT/WIC recipients for up to 4 family members which I found to be quite disheartening that I served 21 years to our great nation only to be told my service doesn’t qualify me or my family for any type of discount. Not that I expect one but the fact that EBT/WIC admission is completely free made me feel as though I had to express my dismay. Our family has always enjoyed the MOS and we have told many families and friends of the fun we’ve had there, but from this point on I will also be sharing the fact that you off free admission for EBT/WIC and nothing for Veterans and family.\nThank you for your time\"\n\n\"When I visited information to voice my issues from walking from the Cambridgeside mall. I was told this happens because of Feb break. I get that however, to not post on social media or your own website is inconsiderate. You need to inform guests where to go and how to plan a visit. Plus, if this does happen often then have a relationship with the mall so my membership with parking isn’t a waste. Very annoyed\"\n\n\"I am trying to give in honor/memory of a deceased relative, but clicking on 'give in honor of someone' on the site https://mos.org/make-a-gift takes me to the monthly giving site.\"\n\n\"We arrived with a toddler planning to park knowing I had w/ membership free parking. Lot was full and we were directed to Galleria lot. Now told parking is not reimbursed @ Galleria. One of the benefits of membership is the free parking which we could not get reimbursed.\"\n\n\"Charles River Exhibit: The section on sewers - when tiles are placed one of the options says rainwater enters sewer system which is incorrect.\"\n\n\"Absolutely above and beyond expectations! From Megan and the girls @ the box office to Patrick in security to the fabulous Marc S. 25 yrs. in customer service and I was blown away! We love you guys.\"\n\n\"The discovery center is always crowded and normally has a wait list. Unfortunately, our experience with the center has always been negative. The wait list is not properly managed and we have had to go home without the experience of the discovery center. The kids eagerly look forward to it and so far they have been disappointed. It would be great and appreciated if you take great care managing the wait list.\"\n\n\"We are members and we love the Museum.  But yesterday, for at least the second time, the parking garage door malfunctioned and nearly injured a small child in a stroller.  PLEASE get this fixed.  I put my leg in the doorway to activate the sensor that is supposed to make the door stop closing and reopen. But the door kept closing.  Other people frantically pushed the \"\"open\"\" button in the elevator which also did NOT work. The door nearly crunched the poor girl in the stroller and horrified her mom. (Fortunately, my wife and two children were already safely inside the elevator.)\nIt's a science museum, so surely someone on staff has the technological wherewithal to fix this door. Again, it has been malfunctioning like this for a long time (months maybe?) as I have experienced this same issue previously. Thank you.\"\n\n\"The new crowd control line barriers in front of cashier in cafeteria \n very problematic and dangerous . Many with you children can’t keep children close: children grabbing the line/ rope strap. Tripping going around corners.  Absolutely no room to SAFETY maneuver. No room to walk balance trays hold children especially in front of fridges by sandwich station. I saw a child fall bump head on food displayed inside the gudlines. The guideline It’s poorly designed and dangerous \nI tripped over one of the posts as I went through. I tripped over children as children being kids bounced around under the guidelines. It needs to be kid family friendly. The gudlines in front of the cashier in the cafeteria are just another stressful obstacle for parents to have to maneuver ..\"\n\n\"Museum seemed very dusty and couldn't stop sneezing. Displays seem old and out of date.\"\n\n\"Investigation station experiments w/ temperature right sensor isn't working :(\"\n\n\"My family visited today and renewed our membership. The majority of the museum is excellent. However I have to say your Wild Kratts underwater exhibit was a big disappointment. We were there at 9 am and the exhibit didn't open on time, there was a delay while staff searched for someone to turn on the lights. The room is small and enclosed which emphasized how small it was! Why not make it open air? It was also really stark, poor quality (to be frank), and several electronic features were broken. There was none of the \"\"wow\"\" factor your other exhibits have, and it felt more like a small scale children's museum exhibit.\nMy kids were thrilled to go since they are fans of the show, and I feel like many other families were also there specifically for that exhibit. We stayed less than 15 minutes. \nI know we'll get our moneys worth for the membership over the course of a year, because we love the museum of science and there is so much to fill every visit with the permanent exhibits. I'm hoping your other special exhibits this year are higher quality!\"\n\n“To whom this may concern,\nMyself and my four year old daughter came to the museum today from New Hampshire expecting to have a fantastic, fun day of exploring and learning but instead experienced a less than stellar day. Paying 63 plus dollars to not even be able to experiment with hardly anything in the whole museum was extremely frustrating. The field trip groups that were there today were sooooo out of control that it was impossible to gain access to any of the exhibits. We waited upwards of 40 mins to use the seesaw and swings and never got on anything else. My four year old was filling the shark teeth in the Wild Krafts exhibit when two boys walked over and cranked the handle destroying what she was making and then immediately after she fixed it a teenager walked over grabbing all the “teeth” and throwing them around the room. Not one single teacher or museum staff spoke to anyone. My four year old was floored and asked why would someone do that? The exhibit on the ground floor that you can crawl in under the fish tank was filled with at least 40 children screaming and my daughter got trapped inside and had her head smacked off the ceiling trying to get out. I had to crawl over at least 10 children so I could help get her out. Teachers may not have been able to see inside but they certainly could hear the excessive screaming. I know the behavior of school groups is the responsibility of the school, the teachers, chaperones, etc. but today was so frustrating and it was sad to watch children trying to experiment with parents and have these “other” kids just destroying things. I also tried to have a snack in the atrium area and it was impossible so we decided to finish up and go eat in the car. My daughter had a sip of water from her thermos on a bench near the escalators (thinking this was not in an exhibit) and a museum employee came flying out of a door right up to us and raised his voice saying how there was no food or drink allowed. I said I’m sorry I didn’t realize. They cut me off and said read the signs and went back into the door they came out of. I was clearly in the wrong but there is a way to approach people not doing the right thing especially in front of small children. And there were two other families sitting having snack on the same bench who were not spoken to and we weren’t even eating. I love the Museum of Science and have always wanted my child to grow up going there like I did but after today I am appalled at my experience and feel cheated out of not only a lot of money and time but my daughter learned zero about anything today other than how not to behave in public. Thank you for your time.”\n",

As a part of this effort, the Safety Committee is underway reviewing and making improvements to many of our Safety Programs and Policies. The most recently completed program review was for our &ldquo;<a href=\"https:/ / bmos.sharepoint.com / EHSDocs / Extension % 20 Cord % 20 Use % 20 Policy.pdf\ " > Extension Cord Use Program < /a>&rdquo;</p > \n < p > The revised program is located on the < a href = \"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety.aspx\">Environmental Health and Safety Page</a> under the category <u>Electrical</u>. <strong>Please review the revised policy and familiarize yourself with requirements of this program.</strong> The direct link to the policy: <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Extension%20Cord%20Use%20Policy.pdf\">https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Extension Cord Use Policy.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The content of the program has not changed, however, clarifications and illustrations were added to better convey the information. The program still applies to all indoor and outdoor extension cords used at the Museum. There is guidance and regulatory requirements provided for selecting and using appropriate extension cords and surge protectors. Ultimately this information is provided to ensure that you have the information necessary to protect yourself, your colleagues and the Museum from improper use that could lead to equipment failure or an electrical fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;**It is important to remember extension cords and surge protector strips <u>shall not</u> be used in place of permanent wiring and <u>shall not</u> replace the need for installation of outlets and proper wiring where necessary. When wall outlet availability is insufficient, please complete a <a href=\"http://kepler/TIWEB8/scripts/TIWebPortal/TrackItUser.asp\">Facilities Work Order</a> to request installation of additional wall outlets.**</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Below are some highlights from this program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extension cords are intended to supply power <strong>temporarily</strong>.</li>\n<li>Extension cords are prohibited for use with major appliances. Do not use extension cords permanently to power appliances or equipment such as printers, copiers, fans, coffee makers, microwaves, etc.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t run extension cords through walls, ceilings, floors, or windows, over drop down ceilings, or under doors, carpets or rugs, or false floors.</li>\n<li>Light Duty, ungrounded flat-wire ribbon extension cords are not permitted for use at the Museum.</li>\n<li>Grounded, medium to heavy-duty, UL-Listed extension cords, <u>14 gauge or thicker</u>, may be used for temporary use. <em>Do you know what to look for on your cord to ensure you have the right gauge and if it&rsquo;s rated for outdoor use?</em></li>\n<li>Heavy-duty (14 gauge or thicker) multi-plug UL-listed transient voltage surge suppressors may be used to protect sensitive electronic equipment. <em>Not all power strips and adapters offer surge suppression. &ndash;</em><em>do you know what markings to look for to ensure you have the right one?</em></li>\n<li>Do not &ldquo;daisy chain&rdquo; your cords. Extension cords shall not be connected in a series. Plug extension cords and surge protectors directly into the wall outlet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;Inspect those cords! Ensure you have the appropriate cords for your <strong>temporary</strong> power supply needs and help prevent becoming a statistic here at work or at home!</p>\n<p><em>Every year, approximately 2,200 shock-related injuries happen with extension cords and 3,300 home fires originate in extension cords, killing 50 people and injuring about 270 more.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this program, please contact me at x4249 or <a href=\"mailto:cdillard@mos.org\">cdillard@mos.org</a></p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your continued commitment to helping create a safe museum environment.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Christina Dillard</p>\n<p>Christina Dillard | Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EHS) Program Manager</p>\n<p>Museum of Science |&nbsp;Facilities Dept. | One Science Park | Boston, MA 02114-1099</p>\n<p>P 617-589-4249 | F 617-589-0101&nbsp;|M 781-789-1178|&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:cdillard@mos.org\">cdillard@mos.org</a> | <a href=\"http://www.mos.org/\">www.mos.org</a></p>\n\n",

We are now calling on you to help us with a developmental step in the process! \nFrom now until March 26th, we are pilot testing some of our potential citizen science components. We want to know what you, potential citizen scientists, think of certain third party citizen science platforms. This will help us decide which one to use for the final version. Go to this website to get started: https://scistarter.org/noaa\n\nInstructions for pilot testing: \n1.\tYou will be directed to a SciStarter website that holds instructions on how to use three different apps.\n2.\tCreate a free SciStarter account. \n3.\tIf using the app, download 1-3 of the platforms listed from Google Play or Apple Store. If using a computer, sign up on the website online. (Note: To use the MyCoast app/website, you need to be near a coastal environment) \n4.\tCreate a free account for each platform.\n5.\tFollow the instructions for the specific platform(s) you’ve selected. \n6.\tParticipate once or more for each platform you’ve used. \n7.\tTake a brief post survey about your experience using the platform(s) you used: https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/4829713/Citizen-Science-Platform-Survey\n\nThank you for participating in this crucial step in the process!

Wednesday PM briefing (Leo Rosenstein) has been moved to Thursday AM in the Discovery Center</strong>\n</p>\nHi all,\n<p> \nOver the coming week, the Early Childhood Development and Education team will be hosting Living Laboratory researchers onsite to chat with our staff and volunteers about the research they do at the museum, and how they use the scientific process to investigate research questions in fields such as psychology, education, and child development.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease join us to learn more about current research of local university partners happening in our very own halls, and/or to learn more about the Living Laboratory program.\n</p>\n<p>\nFollowing is a schedule of who will be coming when; each researcher will be with us for ½ hour.  Feel free to join for any/all that you would like, invite other interested MOS colleagues, and email me if you would like any more information!\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monday 4/1 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)</strong><br />\nLeo Rosenstein – Lab Manager, <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/lacqlab/home.html\">MIT Language Acquisition Lab</a><br />\nThe Language Acquisition Lab’s central topic of study is how children learn and acquire their native language(s) – how much of it is biologically determined versus experience-based, how does it change as children mature, and what strategies do children employ in order to extract and use the relevant information in language experiences? Members of the lab are currently studying how children learn the rules of grammar, and how their use of these rules changes as they grow. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tuesday 4/2 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)</strong><br />\nPeggy Li – Research Fellow, <a href=\"https://www.harvardlds.org\">Harvard University Laboratory for Developmental Studies</a><br />\nThe Laboratory for Developmental Studies represents a multidisciplinary group of researchers interested in discovering more about the way infants and young children learn about the world that surrounds them. Dr. Li’s research primarily focuses on the relationship between children’s language and cognitive development, and how they both may rely on and grow from one another. Currently in Living Laboratory, she is investigating the role language plays in the creation of new representational structures and concepts for children.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tuesday 4/2 at 12:30 (Lower Morse)</strong><br />\nPeter Blake – Lab Director, <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/cdl/sdll/\">Boston University Social Development and Learning Lab</a><br />\nThe Social Development and Learning Lab conducts cognitive and behavioral experiments with children regarding social concepts such as cooperation and competition, ownership and private property, fairness and other social norms, and learning through imitation and communication. Dr. Blake’s current Living Laboratory research investigates children’s perceptions of fairness.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Wednesday 4/3 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)</strong><br />\nJenna Alton – Lab Manager, <a href=\"https://www.bulearnlab.com\">Boston University Social Learning Lab</a><br />\nThe Social Learning Laboratory’s research focuses on children’s use of social and cognitive information when learning about the world. An issue central across children’s development is how they navigate diverse sources of information, such as testimony from teachers, family or peers, or their own inquiry and evidence.  Jenna’s current Living Laboratory research investigates how children’s exploration and perception of an activity may be influenced by the type of information they receive from adults.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Wednesday 4/3 at 12:30 (Classroom A)</strong><br />\nLeo Rosenstein – Lab Manager, <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/lacqlab/home.html\">MIT Language Acquisition Lab</a><br />\nThe Language Acquisition Lab’s central topic of study is how children learn and acquire their native language(s) – how much of it is biologically determined versus experience-based, how does it change as children mature, and what strategies do children employ in order to extract and use the relevant information in language experiences?

Members of the lab research topics such as how children use audio-visual clues to enhance their attention to faces and understanding of language, and how these early experiences affect attentional processing and language development.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Friday 4/5 at 9:30 (Discovery Center)</strong><br />\nRebecca Peretz-Lange – Doctoral Student, <a href=\"https://sites.tufts.edu/cdlab/\">Tufts University Cognitive Development Lab</a><br />\nThe Cognitive Development Lab’s goal is to better understand how children learn about the physical and social world – about the objects they play with, the people they learn from, and how both interact in their everyday life.  Much of the lab’s research focuses on how children learn about cause and effect.  Rebecca’s current Living Lab research investigates how children reason about other people’s behaviors.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Friday 4/5 at 12:30 (Classroom A)</strong><br />\nOlivia Soledad – Research Assistant, <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/cdl/developing-minds-lab/\">Boston University Developing Minds Lab</a><br />\nThe Developing Minds Lab studies how infants and children perceive, understand, and remember “the vast amount of visual information available in the world and carve it up into the meaningful units that are most relevant to us as humans: namely, inanimate objects and animate agents.” Olivia’s current work in the Living Laboratory investigates how children’s memory may be influenced by societal factors.\n</p>",

This organization has done a great job keeping our river beautiful and has received many accolades for its work. \n\nFull day GSE’s will pick up and drop off in Brighton at the DCR Nonantum Road Boat Ramp. (Please visit www.cleanupboat.org for directions.) \nNEW GSE SIGN-UP PROCESS THIS YEAR—**It is important to complete these steps in order**  \n\nHow do I sign up?\n1. Go to website- cleanupboat.org.>Click on ‘Volunteers’>within the first paragraph, click on the word ‘here’ >this will bring you to the volunteer sign up page. \n2. Sign up for an available date, either under the Volunteer 1 or Volunteer 2 fields (please know that the maximum number of Volunteers is now two per day) and then fill in your contact information and select from the drop down that you are a Museum of Science Employee. **Due to overwhelming demand, we are limiting sign ups to one GSE shift per season.\n3. You will receive a confirmation email from ‘Signup Genius’ (be sure to check your clutter/junk folders if you don’t see it right away).\n4. Next, sign up for the corresponding GSE through our GSE sign up system.  Please note that the GSE dates listed through the Museum GSE offerings may not match as being available on cleanupboat.org. This is due to other volunteers, separate from MOS employees, signing up through the cleanupboat.org website. This is why it is important to sign up on the Clean Up Boat website first.\nIf you signed up for a shift on cleanupboat.org and notice that there is no corresponding GSE sign up, please let me know.\n\nWhat if I need to cancel or reschedule my GSE?\n1. Cancel your GSE using the Museum GSE cancellation process.\n2. Go to cleanupboat.org and back to the Volunteer sign up page. Right above where the list of dates begins, you will see a link titled ‘Already signed up? You can change your sign up.’ and follow the instructions from there. I have found that the easiest thing to do is the 'enter your email' option and it will email you a link. Once cancelled, you will receive a cancellation confirmation email. If you are cancelling your GSE within 3 days of your scheduled date, in addition to canceling on the volunteer page, please contact your Captain directly to let them know.  Captain contact information is located at the top of the volunteer sign up page.\n\nThis GSE is fun, rewarding, and on most days a good way to get out and enjoy the weather! Read over the GSE description carefully and be sure to sign up for a day that you know you can commit to. \n",

		"messageSubject": "March 2019 Comment Cards",
		"messageBody": "March 2019 Comment Card Report\n\n\"Hello! The museum is great, but why most exhibits show USC units only? You have word 'science' in your name, and language of science is SI units. Also it makes things difficult for all foreign tourists (except those who are from Liberia) as all other countries are metric.\nBoston aquarium is a good example of handling this, all their exhibits show units in both systems.\"\t\t\n\"Hi. I was just looking at your Omni Theater shows and I’m disappointed that the options listed for schools aren’t available to the public. I’m most interested in seeing the shows available to schools and hope you may consider playing them to the public. The Extreme Weather, South Pacific, and Lewis and Clark are all very intriguing. Is there a way to reserve the theater to see them without being part of a school program?\"\n\n\"I am looking for something to do with my daughter, who is 10, on Pi Day. I am disappointed that the museum is not offering any special activities after school hours.\"\n\n\"I would simply like you to update your info tag on Mountain Lion exhibit.\nI can say with absolute certainty that my brother, Bill and I three days apart spotted in Connecticut a Mountain Lion I want to say in 2017. Bill and friend spotted a  Mountain Lion in Redding area in CT. Three days later, in the Audubon in Fairfield, I spotted a Mountain Lion. Both sightings were reported to Animal control Authorities of both towns.\nThese sightings came after there was an article in National Geographic a few yrs ago of a Mountain Lion killed on  I-95 in Milford, CT.\"\n\n\"Sean at the Information Desk was the catalyst in finding our lost wallet. He arranged for us to look unencumbered between shows at the Omni. We found the wallet thanks to his efforts. His kind & caring way was appreciated. Thank you Sean\"\n\n\"The Hall of Human Life wristband for me isn’t working.\"\t\n\n\"For an organization that prides itself and brags about reducing its carbon foot print, your recycling in the cafeteria is extremely poor. No plastic or paper recycling at all. I expect more from the Museum of Science.\"\n\n\"I think that the Pi Day Facebook profile picture change call to action should have been a Facebook profile frame instead of a whole image. I think it would have given a lot more exposure and more people would have actually done it.”\n\"When I signed up for membership at the Museum, the person taking my information incorrectly entered my email.\nI have been unable to delete this incorrect email from my email preferences.\nNote: I have added my correct email to my email preferences.  Please delete the incorrect email  from the email preferences and from your database.  Thank you.\"\n\"Oh my! What a wondrous place. Oh if only I was a child again!\"\n\"Today me and my family visited the planetarium and it was a very experience. We decided to grab a snack from the food area. We got fries from the grill area, we were looking the ketchup and saw the dressing for the salad thinking it was near that. There was a dressing that was red so my 10 year old daughter went to check if it was ketchup, she put her finger on the top to try it. Me and my wife were in the process of explaining to her that she cannot do that and while we were telling her a staff member scolded my daughter about what she had done. They made her feel scared and horrible about what she had done. This was very rude! We were handling it. I am very disappointed about our experience today.”\n\n\"Hello Museum of Science, \nI hope your week went well! I recently went to your \"\"Coldplay Experience Light Show\"\". I truly enjoyed it and wanted to let you know how inspirational and relaxing it was. After taking a look at your other featured artists, I recognized the variety you had. An idea which occurred to me is that a Queen light show would also be amazing. As the movie Bohemian Rhapsody recently came out and has received raving reviews, this addition could also attract a great crowd. Just think about it. Queen has had a great uproar and it could be a fantastic way to introduce and represent a larger music variety. I know I would thoroughly enjoy this show and many others would too. The vivacious, inspiring and complex music would be a great landscape for some mindbending visual effects. \nPlease let me know what you think of this idea! Thank You.\"\n\n\"I attended your free Friday night with my wife and daughter yesterday. I was arriving late to meet them and when I arrived I was able to walk in, unchecked, past the turnstile attendant. I didn’t get a ticket like everyone else. I didn’t get looked at.  While I’m not typically a paranoid person, I didn’t see one single security guard the entire time I was there. There were droves of children and families. But not one security guard. At least not at the entrance/exit. In today’s world the idea that that many children and people could congregate in a public place with little or no oversight is slightly unsettling. Whether it’s an act of violence or an abduction, there was not a single preventative measure of note. \nI thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the program and I love being able to introduce children to the sciences in such an enjoyable way. I would love to see an added measure of security to ensure the safety of everyone there.\"\n\n\"When I log in as a member there is a box on top of the display that says 'Hello,' and my name.  There is no obvious way to logout.  Instead, if I click on this 'Hello,' box there are 2 lines: 'Your Account' and 'Not' followed by my name and 'Logout'.  There really should be three lines: 'Your account\"\", 'Not', 'logout'  I should not have to logout by saying that I am not me.\"\n\n\"Add a laser tag arena. Laser tag is VERY popular. Do some thing like the butterfly gardens, where you have an entry every 35 min (games last 30 min)\"\n\n\"Can you please direct this email to the curator of the Hall of Human Life?\nThe diet recommended in the Hall of Human Life is seriously flawed, as exhibited by the diabetes stations recommending refraining from salmon and the hypertension station encouraging salmon consumption.  Caution about sugar consumption is vague and needs to be more explicit -- it merely references an excess of calories.  And a station on contributing factors to heart disease was absent.\nI laud this robust exhibit, but its flaws are a disservice to its many viewers.\nWith Boston being a center for medical care, what can be done about a notable nutritionist bringing accuracy, completeness, and consistency to the Hall of Human Life?\"\n\n\"I write this at the risk of seeming a whiner or a lush: I am at the ticketed event for the Washburn challenge this evening and I am really, really bummed that you closed the bar service. I had a hellacious day at work, I rushed to get here and was really looking forward to 5-10 minutes of shaking off the day with a glass of wine before the lecture. (I actually got off the Green Line and got into a Lyft because I knew I’d be late otherwise.) When I got to the bar at 6:50, the catering staff was fairly curt in telling me the bar service was closed. Which is really annoying. I get it that you don’t want to have people lingering but seriously, just one glass of wine? Too much to ask? Fine, I’ll at least grab a snack. Except you already took away the plates so... guess not. \nBetter next time on the invitation say the wine and cheese reception ends at 6:45, not 7. Super grumpy. Thanks for listening.\"\n\"Hello, I visited the natural history section of your museum and I noticed that you have about 4 passenger pigeon specimens in the bird area, and I would like to inform the museum about an ongoing project that is actually working on 'de-extincting' the passenger pigeons. \nThe project is set to begin next year, with wild release in 20 years if successful. I think it may be a good idea to see about creating a poster near a passenger pigeon specimen. This organization is also working on several different projects such as the, Heath Hen, Woolly Mammoth, Black-Footed Ferret, and Horseshoe crab. \nI will leave a link to the passenger pigeon page for reference.  \nAlso, this technology has been proven to be at least practical, when a species of extinct wild goat was de-extinct in 2003 but only survived for 10 minutes.”\n\n\"Good evening, my son is a music composer major at Oberlin Conservatory. All of his peers at Oberlin, Berklee, Manhattan School of Music, etc. are highly creative, talented musicians. Many composers studying at American conservatories have limited opportunities to exhibit their pieces to the public. My proposal is to host a year long laser light show series exhibiting conservatory students'' pieces at the Museum Of Science. \nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience, if you are interested in my proposal.\nThank you for your consideration.\"\n\n\"I spent 45 dollars in your cafe yesterday 3/27/19 around 3pm. The entire time sitting at a table workers were converging on us putting chairs up, cleaning up, removing chairs at the table we were sitting at. Basically it was truly an unpleasant experience. Like they were telling us to hurry it up. Then another group of workers dressed in black did the same thing. Took over the area. I mean what are you?  A cafe for visitors or is it your policy to close up shop while you claim to be 'open'?\"\n\n\"March 29, 2019 was the first time I visited the museum I fell in love with it it was beautiful my son had a great time and went with the Webster a elementary school it was great we had fun I am really actually excited to go again thank you\"\n\n\"I was here for 4:00pm Omni Show. Since I came early I wanted to take an advantage of no show tickets of 3pm show. Even one lady came out feeling sick, I wasn't allowed to get in to watch the show. The fact is there are empty seats inside the theater and I am not be able to watch the show. The system is not efficient. Can you fix it for future cases?\"\n\n\"I like how you made eye pictures. It was fun being confused!\"\n\n\"Our overall experience on our visit was good however the dining area was a mess the process of getting the food was ok the food was hot and came out fast however once we had our food the checking out was a nightmare I do not blame the cashier personnel it was overwhelming the number of people needing to checkout and the three cashiers to do. I would suggest or any busy day investing in extra registers that could be added on a day like yesterday could be a stand alone you can add on or something but yesterday was a mess and makes me sad because everything else was good just management needs to correct this\"\n",

Our manager of Living Collections, Jackie Peeler and BarB Harvey met with the accreditation committee today to discuss the results of our application and onsite inspection. The committee voted to accredit us for the next five years. Huge thanks to everyone as this is a museum wide accomplishment. Many departments and staff worked to make this happen, it truly takes a village! Special thank you to the Living Collections team for all of their incredibly hard work as they all spent the last year and a half prepping for this. They did a tremendous job! They are well deserving of any congratulations or high fives you want to pass along should you see them.",

		"messageSubject": "Active Directory Upgrade Tuesday 4/23/19 6pm - 12am",
		"messageBody": "On the evening of 4/23 starting at 6:00 pm, a series of upgrades will be performed on our active directory domain controller servers in our MOS data center.  These upgrades will be staggered throughout the night to minimize end user impact.  Part of this upgrade will involve migrating some of the services on the wireless side to new servers.  This will enable the Museum to take advantage of new and improved capabilities within our environment and will help us prepare for future IT project improvements to both systems and networks.   This will also allow us to continue to receive support from Microsoft by updating to a newer more stable platform.\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nInformation Technology will be replacing our existing domain controllers, which respond to security authentication requests (logging in, checking permissions, etc.) and is used by IT when granting access to museum resources.  During our outage window, we are working with an outside vendor to address any issues should they arise.  \n\nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nDo not panic! When these upgrades take effect, there is little expected impact on the internal network or network access. There could be some delays in access for short durations of less than a minute as services flip from the old domain controllers to the new servers. On the wireless side, we do expect that when services are migrated, users may need to disconnect and reconnect to the wireless network, as some of the networking options will be changing, and the end devices will need to reconnect to get this updated information.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nIf you need to be on any of our WI-Fi networks during this time frame and have issues with connectivity, please wait a few minutes and then disconnect and try again.  We expect this will clear up any connection issues.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n",

The project team continues to work on stabilizing the system over the next week and will revisit the timeline and send an update to staff once we have a new go live date.\n\nThis means that staff should continue to use Track-It until the new tool is rolled out to the Museum.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Museum of Science has some great news to share!  We are implementing a new work order and customer service portal that centralizes requests for IT, Facilities, C&W, CRM Systems and Exhibit Maintenance.  This new system, Service Now, will allow us to retire the legacy Track It application and replace it with more flexible and integrated work order environment.\n\nWe are planning to roll out the new platform on Wednesday, May 1st.  Please note the following schedule of activities in order to support the launch: \n•  Mid day on Tuesday, April 30th: the current Track-it Work Order System will be taken offline.

		"messageSubject": "April is Distracted Driver Awareness Month",
		"messageBody": "April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month, and the Safety Committee would like to share some statistics and resources on distracted driving. You can also look at the National Safety Council website for more resources and information:\n\nhttps://www.nsc.org/pages/ddam/ddam-materials\n\nEvery day at least 9 people die and 1,000 more are injured on U.S. roads in distracted driving crashes, caused by cell phones, dashboard touchscreens, voice commands and other in-vehicle technologies that pose a threat to safety, according to the National Safety Council.\nDriving with any form of distraction is a choice. Everyone can choose to glance at the screen or respond to a text while sitting at a red light. April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month , making now the perfect time to consider the consequences of distracted driving. However, if you are driving on Museum business, you are prohibited from using your cell phone while driving. \nThe official policy from the Museum handbook: Vehicle Use - It is the policy of the Museum that cell phones and pagers are not to be used by staff while operating a motor vehicle.  Using telecommunications devices, even with a hands -free accessory, is a distraction that reduces the driver’s ability to react to hazards.  This applies to personal cell phones used for, or while conducting, Museum business.\n\nFast Facts about Distracted Driving:\n•\t5 seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting; traveling at 55 mph, that is equivalent to driving the length of a football field blindfolded.\n•\tVoice-to-text is even more distracting than holding your phone. You're mentally distracted by composing the message and visually distracted by common autocorrect errors. \n•\tEven at stoplights, it is important to remain an attentive driver; a AAA study shows that people are distracted up to 27 seconds after they send a voice text.\n•\t7% of all drivers at any given time are using their phones while driving, but cognitive neuroscientist, David Strayer, says only about 2.5% of the population is actually capable of multitasking.\n•\tDrivers who are talking on their cell phone are 4x more likely to crash — drunk drivers share those odds. The odds of crashing if you’re texting while driving is 8x times the normal rate, meaning it doubles the crash likelihood of driving drunk.\n\nSo how do we resist the temptation? Here are three ideas to help curb this terrible habit: \n1.\tGet your phone out of reach. Turn your phone on silent—or airplane mode—and place it in your glove compartment. If you’re still too tempted, throw it in the trunk before getting behind the wheel. \n2.\tDistract yourself—safely. Try listening to interesting radio stations, podcasts or audiobooks. None of these are as attention-absorbing as texting, which takes both your attention and your eyes off the road. \n3.\tUse an app to prevent use.  Some wireless providers offer a Drive mode App, which can detect when your car is traveling, stop you from sending texts, and even send an automatic response saying you’re driving and can’t talk right now. \n\nPlease remain safe on the roads and avoid distracted driving.\n\nThe Safety Committee\n",

The project team continues to work on stabilizing the system over the next week and will revisit the timeline and send an update to staff once we have a new go live date.\n\nThis means that staff should continue to use Track-It until the new tool is rolled out to the Museum.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Museum of Science has some great news to share! We are implementing a new work order and customer service portal that centralizes requests for IT, Facilities, C&W, CRM Systems and Exhibit Maintenance. This new system, Service Now, will allow us to retire the legacy Track It application and replace it with more flexible and integrated work order environment.\n\nWe are planning to roll out the new platform on Wednesday, May 1st. Please note the following schedule of activities in order to support the launch:\n• Mid day on Tuesday, April 30th: the current Track-it Work Order System will be taken offline. Any new request that you need to submit that day can be emailed to ithelp@mos.org and the Service Desk will assure that a ticket is entered for you in the new system\n• Evening of Tuesday, April 30th: all active work orders will be migrated from Track It to the new system\n• Morning of Wednesday, May 1st: the new portal will be available to all staff at https://museumofscience.service-now.com/. You will sign in with your museum user name and password. There will be also be updated links from the Hub for easy navigation and access\n\nService Now is accessible 24x7 from anywhere with an Internet connection and works across operating systems and multiple browsers.\n\nBelow is a short list of the enhancements you can expect with the new service:\n• Better communication and updates for end users\n• Searchable Service Catalog by department\n• Email notifications and updates to tickets and work orders\n• Ability to trace reoccurring issues and trends\n• Ability to share a request with several departments and add more than one user on a tickets\n• Search feature that will make is much easier for an end user to find what they need from an area\n\nAfter the rollout, there will be continued growth and improvement in the platform as we get feedback and are able to implement additional functionality. The platform has many features that we look to implementing in the future including an extensive, searchable Knowledge Base and giving more tools to the technicians, like location updates, to streamline requests and needs for the museum.\n\n*Information and Support Sessions\nThere will be 4 user drop in sessions to learn more about Service Now:\n• Thursday, April 25th from 2:30-3:30pm in the Engineers Enclave\n• Friday, April 26th from 2:00-3:00pm in the Engineers Enclave\n• Monday, April 29th from 11:00-12:00pm in the Engineers Enclave\n• Wednesday, May 1st from 11:00-12:00pm in Hodge\n\nIf you cannot make one of the four sessions but would still like a training session or if you have any questions or comments, please email SNAdminTeam@mos.org.\n\nWe’re very excited about rolling out this customer service platform and look forward to your feedback.",

		"messageBody": "April 2019 Comment Card Report\n\n\"I am having trouble logging into my account.  It told me my email and/or password was wrong.  So I had a reset email sent to me and it won't let me click on the button to reset.  Nothing happens.\nThanks for your help.\"\n\n\"I went to three websites and it doesn't tell when Cuba ends\nIt tells you that you must sign up for a time\nI don't get it\"\n\n\"I know the store is Indepnt. but I was appall when I bought stuff, asked for a bag & the staff member said we don't have one but you can BUY ONE for $4 - since when do you have a store with even no paper bags? \nA member for many years - the comment and Idea just very Rude\"\n\n\"The purpose of me buying a membership is so that I can come into your museum and spend some quality time with my children learning about science, taking in a movie, eating at your food vendors.\nI am going to have to reassess this. I planned an evening only to be greeted with a full parking lot and a traffic nightmare. All of your hardwork making the museum better and I felt like I was in line at an over filling MacDonalds with a staff that does not understand they are backing traffic out into the street. On top of the fact that someone was recently killed in that area it was very dangerous. And this was like 7:30 at night. Having work hard all the time I finally had time to see the laser show with my daughter at the late 9:30 show. That did not happen it was a wasted trip gas and time. I don't know what the problem is on a Friday why the parking lot is filled are you renting out spots?\nI've also noticed the parking garage is always filled up even when there is not many people there.\nNow I see you are having 18+ evenings.\nThe purpose of your museum is not a hook up place. Is it really being run by people out to promote science or is this some sort of bad joke. I'm not going to subsidize your adults only nights thats not why I buy a membership and spend 400-500 a year between parking tickets and food.\nRIDICULOUS IDEA!!! Maybe you should open a night club next.\"\n\n\n\"Put the show times on the museum phanphlets!\"\n\n\"We visited the MOS a little while back and noticed that many of the newer exhibits were bilingual. Why just two languages?\nIn America, we speak English. If you are going to appeal to our foreign visitors, why not add French, and German? Why just Spanish? I asked you this then and no one responded. I would appreciate a response.\nThanks.\"\n\n\"In 1951, the Boston Society of Natural History (BSNH) began its metamorphosis into the Museum of Science (Boston). What happened to the natural history collections that were associated with the BSNH? Where are they now? \nThank you.\"\n\n\" We LOVE the museum and have recently seen a couple of shows there that I wanted to comment on.\n1 - the David Bowie Planetarium show could not have been better! The graphics were astounding and the music was wonderful.\n2 - we also went to see the Great Barrier Reef movie at the Omni. While it was interesting, it wasn't exactly new, or shot for a big screen. It was almost out of focus and twenty years old. The science in it was sound of course but completely outdated. It was quote disappointing for such a wonderful museum\nJust thought you should know\nThanks\"\n\n\"Today my mother lost her wallet somewhere in the museum. She went several times to ask if anyone found and returned a wallet throughout the day. The last time she went to ask before leaving the staff member just said no and didn’t look anywhere or ask anyone around them if anyone turned something in. We asked what to do because the parking ticket was also in the wallet.  Once we said that (the parking ticket was inside) they said that’s a problem and decided to look around and needed the draw to get unlocked. The wallet was in there the whole time. To not unlock the drawer before knowing the parking ticket was in there. This was not good customer service, clearly seeing my mother was stressed, they could of looked around instead of being rude and acting like we were bothering them. Very disappointed. Working with the public I know that is not how to act when a customer has a question or needs help. Thank you.\"\n\n\"I'm reaching out in regards to a visit I made recently with my three children; ages 8yo, 4yo, & 3yo.  I renewed our annual membership and expanded it to the five-person package because I had my two youngest with me, in addition to my 8yo, and we all were really disappointed.  I'm reaching out to request a refund for the difference from the five-person membership back down to the two-person membership.  The museum does not really offer much for the younger crowd and they were actually in the way of other museum visitors; while most attractions were visually appealing to them, they just could not understand what the exhibits actually were about.  I was quite shocked because of the charge of any person age 3yo and older.  I assumed there were appropriate attractions and interactions specifically for this age.  We specifically visited to see the Wild Kratts exhibit and we couldn't have been more let down.  It was terrible.  My children, Wild Kratts lovers, were shocked when we walked into the room to see that we had traveled 1.25hrs to see this exhibit.  Because of the ages of my two youngest and lack of facilities for them, we ended up leaving early and plan to return with just my oldest.\"\n\n\"Was reading about this new exhibit at Museum of London. You should try doing something like this.\n\n\"My family does not have WIC or EBT.   Its a shame that families have to save up to visit the museum. Rates are  slightly ridiculous for working class families\"\n\n\"I brought a group of 20 Romanian students to museum - Had water for them but had forgotten cups. In cafeteria, buyin lunch. They would NOT give me the small cups - finally gave 5 - Had to bring each student up to ask - & they didn't speak English No excuse for this discourtesy.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to change my address on the site, but it says 'This address is invalid.'\nPlease update the address on my account.\"\n\n\"I must say me and my family were a tad bit disappointed with the museum this visit. Thank goodness we had library passes. For the money that is actually charged per person, I would demand my many back. My family and I were expecting more interactive exhibits that would make you leave feeling you learned something, amazed, and that science is exciting.  These exhibits, other than being geared towards extremely young children, were tired and boring.\"\n\n\"I wanted to submit a comment about the Magic Tree House planetarium show. It was really cool and my 4 year old and I have been twice now. It blew my mind the first time I saw it. I do have an issue with the lack of representation of black and brown people in the show though. It feels so incredibly white, both in who is represented and from a cultural perspective (white dominant cultural elements are so prominent). I would think that MOS would at least there be diversity in every show it puts out and that it be working towards inclusivity and racial equity in how it approaches it's programming. I truly hope someone will rise this comment up to those in leadership positions.\"\n\n\" In the human life area we were lucky enough to interact with Alyce who was sharing information on bones. I can't tell you enough how amazing she was, intelligent, knowledgeable, interesting...I could have listened to her so day. So I just wanted to let you know what a gem you have in her!\"\n\n\"Please have a staff member in the dinosaur area! Especially near the T. Rex, our favorite guy. Today I witnessed *many* parents allowing their children to climb the wall, and one who watched while his child played inside the enclosure. This is my biggest (only) pet peeve about the MOS!\"\n\n\"Yesterday, my significant other and I traveled over 2 hours from northern New Hampshire with our children to visit the Museum of Science.  My significant other and I remember visiting the museum as children and we couldn’t wait to share this experience with our kids, ages 9 and 10.  \nThe kids loved the Museum and truly had a ball with the entire experience.  Our youngest especially loved the Lightning! show.  She loved it so much, that when it came time to leave, she decided to purchase a Genius @ Play 8” Plasma Ball from the gift shop to remember the trip.  She used her own money to make this expensive purchase, and carried the box around like it was a trophy.  She couldn’t wait to get it home and set it up in her room.  \nAfter an exhaustive trip back home sitting in several hours of traffic, she raced inside with her prize.  She carefully set it up and was completely devastated to learn that her Plasma Ball didn’t work.\nMy significant other tried to assist her, checking the power source and troubleshooting various other possible issues, but it was no use.  The Plasma Ball is most certainly broken.  \nOf course, I’m not blaming the Museum for the broken toy.  The problem is, it’s not as simple as just packing it back up and returning it to the store.  Without traffic, it would be a significant journey to get back to the Museum to make the return.  Is there another way we can make this right?  It’s heartbreaking to know that the wonderful day we spent at the Museum will be tarnished in her memory by the purchase of this broken Plasma Ball.\"\n\n\"Our visit was incredible. We were running late at lunch so I called and a nice woman was able to move our Omni movie tickets to a later show. When we finally arrived, we found that the elevator from the garage was broken. My son is in a power chair so the elevator is a must. Before I could even come up with a plan to get him into the museum, an employee (sorry I didn't get her name) called on the phone to get some advice. Someone came up and they suggested I go park on the first level. She even went to check to make sure there were spaces (there wasn't when I had driven in). We went to the car and another employee came after us to instruct us to park outside of the museum instead because that would be easier. The level of service was truly above and beyond. Navigating Boston with a wheelchair is almost always a challenge.  I often have to beg, cajole or demand assistance and we always have to wait for help. However, your team made it so much easier and they all did it so pleasantly and almost without any request from us. Thank you!\"\n\n\"Please make a Tupac Shakur Planetarium show.\"\n\n\"Staff member at discovery center unpleasant and not speaking kindly to my four yr old. We asked to wait (at capacity) they said not worth it we close soon.\"\n\n\"Movie on adaptation of animals made NO mention of global warming - M. of NH movie? Awesome museum of course!!!\"\n\n\"Dear Museum of Science,\nPlease can you try to open a Fireman Sam exhibit? It could take about fireman, which are important people on our planet. It is ok if you can't do it.\"\n\n\"My wife and I just bought a premier membership for the Science Museum and took our two small grandchildren, ages 2 and 4.  One main reason for our purchase of the membership was the promise of free parking as advertised on your website.  When we arrived shortly before 10:30am, we were barred from entering the line to the garage and told we could not wait for a space to become available.  I drove around for a half hour before parking at the Galleria.  By the time we were ready to leave the museum, it was pouring rain.   We knew of the rainy forecast but felt the free covered parking would keep us dry.  In addition to all of us getting very wet, I also incurred extra cost to park my car.   Your website led us to believe that with a premier membership, free parking was part of the package.  I am hoping that you will offer me some redress for the inconveniences that I experienced.\"\n\n\"I tried to renew my Teacher partner program card (originally from 2015 but I am in a one-week ASTC membership limbo because I need to receive my local science museum updated card for reciprocal benefits. Your site is not recognizing the domain. Perhaps when I first signed up it was [email] though we haven’t used that domain in years\"\n\n\"Do you think you could add a small exhibit for animals\"\n\n\"Yesterday I came to the museum and pots for the exhibit hall tickets and also if they're 40 movie not being able to see all the sections I want I went back home this morning I came to see the Butterfly gardens and they told me I cannot purchase the ticket because I need to get another exhibit hall ticket which to me sounds in efficient it's for customer service purposes and also the fact that the six dollar that I was happy to pay for that and use it into the Museum butterfly gardens and they told me I cannot purchase the ticket because I need to get another exhibit hall ticket which to me sounds in efficient it's for customer service purposes and also the fact that the six dollar that I was happy to pay for that and use it into the museum\nThis issue could be easily fixed and more revenue produced for the museum if you easily let people purchase additional items within the two or three days after your visit.\"\n\n\"What a great museum! So much to do & so\"\n\n\"I thought it was great\"\n\n\"electrity show\nHave interpreter for deaf or hearing hard.\"\n",

		"messageBody": "Evolving Minds: Why Learning Counterintuitive Scientific Concepts like \nNatural Selection is So Hard\n\nDeb Kelemen\nBoston University\n\nNatural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution, the unifying principle of biology. However, even after instruction, it remains a profoundly misunderstood scientific mechanism. The origin of many such misconceptions can be traced to predictably developing, untaught cognitive biases that are observable from early childhood. And yet, prevailing assumptions about young children’s cognitive limitations mean that, in most countries, comprehensive, causally coherent instruction on natural selection is typically delayed until adolescence–long after folk misunderstandings are likely to have entrenched. \n\nIn this talk, I will overview cognitive developmental research on some of the untutored biases that create challenges for students’ acquisition of evolutionary concepts. These include early developing tendencies to view natural phenomena as intentionally designed and as possessing an immutable essence. I will also discuss recent educational studies exploring young children abilities to accurately learn about evolution from mechanistic explanatory storybooks that have been designed to take these cognitive developmental findings into account. Implications for our understanding of the mutability of cognitive biases and our enduring abilities to accurately learn about counterintuitive scientific concepts will be discussed.\n",

The winning design carried over 150 ducks! The participants and our Museum visitors had a great time, and got to take home some rubber ducks and duck-themed swag from our registration table. We couldn't have done it without our 27 near-peer mentors and our 45 Museum of Science and corporate volunteers, so thank you!\n\nThank you also to HHL, EHI, and Discovery Center staff and volunteers who helped us out by doing engineering and duck-themed activities for visitors throughout the day as part of our Duck 'n' Hover passport activity!

These upgrades will be staggered through their respective evenings to minimize end user impact:\n•\tOn Monday, June 10th, IT will perform upgrades to the wireless switches in preparation for this summer’s full wireless refresh. This work is necessary for the new wireless equipment we will be installing\n•\tOn Wednesday, June 12th, IT will perform upgrades to the network core to patch vulnerabilities and get on the most stable current release. This upgrade will improve functionality on the switches and the security of our infrastructure\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nFor the wireless switch upgrades on the 10th, Information Technology will be upgrading the firmware on seven switches within the Museum. During the upgrade process, wireless access may be unavailable for the following areas: the Gordon Wing, 3rd floor offices and ERC, Box Office and Blue wing, and the Engineer’s Enclave. This work will take place after hours to minimize impact and will not have a Museum-wide scope. \n\nThe network core upgrades on the 12th will affect network access periodically as updates are applied and devices are rebooted. We will have staff on site checking connections and validating our entire infrastructure post-install. \n\nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nOn the 10th, portions of the Museum will have briefly interrupted wireless network access, but the impact should be minimal. \n\nOn the 12th, network and file services may be briefly unavailable. We will be staggering the install to minimize impact.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nIf you need to be on any of our Wi-Fi networks after hours on the 10th, affected areas may be unavailable briefly. If you need to use the Internet, your hardwired connection will not be impacted at all. \n\nOn the 12th, we will not be starting until after the box office has closed, and will be doing everything we can to minimize the impact so you will not be required to do anything.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n",

		"messageBody": "May 2019 Comment Card Report\n\n\"I would like to give a big shout out to Kellie, who works in the Wild Kratt's Ocean Adventure. I work at the preschool nearby and often visit this exhibit with Kellie as the museum educator. My classroom (10 children aged 18-24 months) decided to visit the exhibit during school vacation  week  (April 15-19). We usually have three teachers, but were short on this day. When we entered the exhibit, we could see that it was crowded and would have to keep an extra eye on the children. Two minutes into their play, 2 children needed immediate diaper changes. Given that we were short a teacher, my co-teacher and I asked Kellie if she could by any chance help us make sure none of the other children ran away. Given how many other children and adults were in the room, Kellie agreed and helped us. We were extremely grateful to have the extra eyes. She is always happy to see our children!\"\n\n\"I attended the Laser Floyd show on 4/20/19 with a friend and we both were left with dismay.  I think of the MOS as a world class museum and thought who could put on a laser show better than a science museum? The lasers were flat and had no continuity with many repeating patterns. It was comparable to having someone with a laser pen do squiggly lines  across a surface or playing with a Spirograph. They were not in synch with the music and didn't take me deeper with the music, it didn't add to the experience. It also didn't use up the roof of the planetarium and was focused only in one section. There were times that it showed potential and then strayed. It was very disappointing and my friend who attended with me felt the same.\nThe imaging behind the lasers was great and the sound was incredible. I just wish the lasers held up to enhancing the experience and helping create a feeling of a journey much like the music does. The ambience of lighting and the mood it can create are a big part of the concert experience and the MOS has a wonderful opportunity to create something out of this world. It would be perfect in such a place as the planetarium!\nThank you for allowing me to comment on my experience and I look forward to visiting the museum as it is always a pleasure.\"\n\n\"We came with 11 patients in wheelchairs and Camden Ballard was amazing! So helpful!!\"\n\n\"1. Nobody knew about raffle advertised in my e-mail.\n2. Mac 'n cheese was not hot by the time I got through the line to pay. Had to ask for my receipt.\n3. Food & Nutrition author's bare belly peeking out was distracting (11:30 A.M. presentation)\n4. A hook on the back of the bathroom door would have been nice. Had to put my coat, etc. on the bathrm floor.\"\n\n“My daughter was in today with her school. She was in the gift shop and accidentally dropped a small snow globe and it broke. The cashier told my daughter that she had to pay for the snow globe and extra because it broke! It was a $2.00 snow globe, my daughter gave the cashier a $10.00 bill and received no change or receipt? I would like to know A. Why did she have to pay extra for something that broke and  B. Why wouldn’t she have received any kind of receipt? She’s in the 4th grade. I am just wondering if this is common at the MOS? I am very disappointed that you do not hire responsible staff that deal with children on a regular basis.”\n\n“I was wondering if you happen to have any promotional items and or a t-shirt you can send my way, I would love to show my support both near and far.”\n\n\"Every time I visit the area, I always make sure your place is a must stop on my itinerary. I am proud to continue to support such a wonderful business like you. I am always very satisfied with the services I am receiving from you. Thank you for always making my experience a great one. I highly recommend you to others to enjoy as well. You always leave me wanting to visit again time after time with family and friends. I am so glad I discovered your place, and never doubting my choice to make that first stop.”\n\n“I was disappointed to see Bodyworlds featured in my regular MOS mailing this morning. \nI understand that the museum needs money but, the discretion the MOS uses in renting our the variable space values dollars over science. E.g.: the NE Patriot's shameless victory lap with token science was a bit galling. Though I suppose a Raytheon exhibit is also a plug but, at least that's science. I also understand that anatomy is science but, when I see ads for Bodyworlds, I can only think of loved ones who have died and those corpses are not there for science but, to be taped at not by or for anatomists.”\nThank you, still love the MOS\"\n\n\"Hello I am emailing you because of an issue we had during lunch. We ate at the food court and it was $47.66 for four drinks a salad 2 chicken fingers and fries and a slice of pizza. I am the one that had the pizza from pucks and it was terrible. It was on a giant piece of focaccia bread from what I could tell. It tasted like it was from a freezer and it was 8$ I would have been better off going to a pizza shop down the road for that price highway robbery. I don't like being rude so I did not go and complain to the person working but something needs to be done for these prices it was roughly a $250 day and we love the museum and plan on coming back for body worlds but I can't see spending a fortune on food when  parking and the gift shop and ticket prices are already pushing the budget. I'm sure that's good for the museum but for us it's a deterrent from wanting to come back on our family outings. Again biggest complaint is the prices for things and that awful pizza. Thank you\"\n\n“Impossible Triangle in the Optical Illusions--Put orange stripes on the carpet from wall to box so people know they're walking in the middle of something.\"\t\t\n\n\"Hi. You are all doing a great job. Love you.\"\t\t \n\n\"Your website team probably knows this, but just in case, please forward this to them.\nAt the moment, your website is not working properly in MS Edge.  It works well in Chrome, but there are lots of errors on Edge.  If you need further details (version info, etc.) just contact me.\"\n\n\"Can you adopt a model recycling program, including composting, bottles/cans, some plastics, & trash?\"\n\n\"I wanted to write regarding my visit to the museum today.  We attended specifically for the Wild Kratts under the sea exhibit.  Because of how expensive the tickets were, we purchased a membership, to try and take advantage of the museum this summer.  When we walked into the exhibit, we were VERY disappointed.  The room was TINY, and geared towards really young children.  My daughter had been extremely excited for this, and instead of being excited, she started to cry.  We walked around the small room, and then walked right out the door.  My daughter actually thanked me for getting her out of there..  She now is telling me that she never wants to go back, and to be honest with you, I don't blame her.  I too, have no desire to come back.  At the very expensive price we just paid for the membership, I am insanely disappointed, and not sure how to handle this.. Please help.\"\n\t\t\t\n\"Hi.  My only slightly negative experiences were the attendant at the gate would not let my students get a stamp.  I did not get a sufficient explanation why.   Also, the electricity demonstration was much below the level of understanding of the AP Physics students that I brought.  I can understand this because you had to accommodate students that were in grade school.  I don’t know how this can be fixed, but I just wanted to let you know.  We love the MOS\"\n\n\"Was very disappointed at the treatment from the cafe in the red wing. I was going to pay for my food, and was screamed at by a worker to go a certain way to the cashier. Which was weird because there was no one in line. I proceeded to sit down and eat when another staff member came over and started being rude about how I grabbed food from the display. Which in the first place had NO SIGN. They yelled at me to give it back which caught me off guard as I had no intentions of eating it at this point. I won't be back to this museum as the staff is nothing but rude.\"\n\n\"This is fun!\"\n\n\"Please forward this message to the Board of Trustees as well as Management.\nI have been a member off and on for decades and I appreciate the work you do.\nI am sad and upset to see that you are scheduling \"\"Body Worlds.\"\"  I am sure you are fully aware of the many controversies of obtaining bodies for this purpose.  The statement that they have been \"\"legally obtained\"\" is not an excuse for profiting and exhibiting a person's body for commercial purposes.\nEvery human being is sacred and their bodies need to be honored not plastcized and put on display for \"\"educational purposes.\"\"  We have adequate textbooks and medical cadavers for this purpose that are found in educational materials already.\nI am ashamed of the group who approved this and I respectfully request that you withdraw this  exhibit. Until it is withdrawn, I will do all I can to influence everyone I can to NOT attend at the Museum of Science while disrepected bodies are being exhibited.\"\n\n\"As MOS members we are very disappointed to learn that the MOS is associating itself with the questionable ethics of Dr Gunther von Hagens. It is clear from many news reports including NPR that the bodies in the Body Worlds exhibit may be on display without the consent those individuals. The company behind Body Worlds has a murky history with documentation of the cadavers used. It is troubling that MOS could not resist this sideshow-like display which may include exploiting cadavers of unwilling participants. We understand that the dissections are truly amazing. However it is troubling MOS chose not to be an example of ethics in science and instead is taking a deep dive with this display.\"\n\n\"I would like to say thanks for the Museum of Science. Museum of Science provided free tickets for all my 4th graders English Program. It was the first and only field trip they had this academic year. During visit, they had so much fun while learned electricity, human body, math, and nutrition.\nI am sure that it was a learning experience that they will remember forever!\"\n\n\"Please bring back Mirror Maze\"\n\n\"For Red Sox weekend, will you have the demonstration of Bernoulli & ball flight, it was cool in the Science of Sports exhibit. Would love to see it again on Red Sox weekend. There was a plastic golf, baseball football & a tennis model that was put into a jet of air & we got to try it out for ourselves.\"\n\n\"I am disappointed that there is almost nothing on climate change! These children lives will be profoundly influenced by climate change - yet nothing! Not science - just entertainment. Do you get funding from the fossil fuel industry?\"\n\n\"Just a note to let you know how disappointed I am that you are not making the Red Sox weekend schedule available on line or on the phone. For a 2 day, 8 hr per day event, I think it's a bit unreasonable to keep the schedule a secret and asking us (yes I am a member) to come in in person to find out about the schedule of programs. Kind of unrealistic to expect us to block out the entire weekend to attend an event/program or two in which we are interested -especially when there is apparently a brochure which will be available in person. Not very welcoming or accommodating a system. I have been checking the website for several weeks looking for the schedule, without success.\"\n",

		"messageBody": "<p>Happy <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/pages/nsm-public-materials\">National Safety Month</a> from your <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety.aspx\">MOS Safety Committee</a>! With help from our colleagues we are going to offer some Spring/Summer Safety Tips over the next few weeks, to help remind you that safety doesn&rsquo;t stop at the door of the Museum!</p>\n<p>Our first article reminds us how to safely live with our &ldquo;wild&rdquo; neighbors.</p>\n<p>What happens when you put nearly 6 million people on 5 million acres with native wildlife? As the people move in, the animals learn to adapt, but their adaptations aren&rsquo;t always so cute or appreciated by humans. Bunny Watson of the Live Animal Care Center put together a very informative <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Living%20with%20wildlife%20in%20Massachusetts.pdf\">Tip Sheet</a> (<a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Living%20with%20wildlife%20in%20Massachusetts.pdf\">https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Living with wildlife in Massachusetts.pdf</a>) that will help you avoid conflict with your wildlife neighbors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Here are a few highlights of how to <strong>be a good neighbor</strong>!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you leave it out &hellip; they will come. Store food securely!</li>\n<li>Winter is for the birds! Take your bird feeder down in the Spring and Summer.</li>\n<li>Limited access isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; seal those gaps! If you want to stop unwanted guests, identify access points into your home and seal them tight.</li>\n<li>Good Fences make good neighbors! Use fencing around your vegetable garden or it will be a buffet.</li>\n<li>If you have wildlife that is being a nuisance DO NOT relocate it yourself. It is illegal to move wildlife to a different area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To Learn More please <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Living%20with%20wildlife%20in%20Massachusetts.pdf\">click here</a>! And please don&rsquo;t take matters into your own hands. Let the experts help!</p>\n<p>If there's a concern about wildlife on the Museum property, please do not attempt to interact with the animal. Note the location and contact the live animal center x0333. </p>\n<p>Please, do NOT feed any wildlife seen on the property. Be sure that any food is cleaned up and if trash barrels are full please notify C&amp;W. Keeping the area clean will reduce wild visitors. </p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued commitment this month and every month for helping create a safe museum environment.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:safety_group@mos.org\">The MOS Safety Committee</a></p>",

She has accepted a position as the Events Senior Manager with The MBA Tour, a company that connects top business schools with prospective MBA candidates through international events and conferences. Maggie looks forward to traveling internationally with the team, and implementing new technologies as a part of their overall event strategy.  \n\nIn the past year and a half, Maggie has been an asset in the planning and execution of significant Museum events such as Chairman’s Circle featuring Author Dan Brown, Celebration of Seafood with WPC Chef Eric Klein, and Discoverer’s Science Uncorked at City Winery. These few events and countless others are testaments to her ingenuity, professionalism and creative spirit; all responsible for producing many beautiful memories for our donors, members and staff. \n\nI can personally attest that the standards for recognition events at the Museum of Science have been elevated because of Maggie’s commitment to outstanding hospitality, knowledge of the latest culinary trends, and eye for design. Her ability to multitask the most complex event details and handle interactions with vendors and guests with poise and sincere care should be applauded and is a learning opportunity for us all.\n\nPlease join me in saying “Bon Voyage” to our dear friend and colleague. Maggie, you will be sorely missed! \n\nBest regards,\nJason\n",

		"messageBody": "<h3>Happy <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/pages/nsm-public-materials\">National Safety Month</a> from your <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety.aspx\">MOS Safety Committee</a>! This week we have more safety tips to help us recognize June as National Safety Month.</h3>\n<p>This week&rsquo;s safety tips have been shared with us by Megan Gregory from our Research and Evaluation Team (Thank you for this great information Megan!) Her passion for bicycle safety should help us all be safer when traveling on our roadways as a true bicycle enthusiast or as an occasional weekend rider on your local bike path.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> Bicycle safety starts with <strong>Proper Maintenance</strong> .</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get at least one professional tune-up each year, but make sure that your tires are inflated and in good condition, and that your brakes are effective before every ride.</li>\n<li>Remember the <strong>ABCs</strong> of checking your bike!</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>A </strong>- Check your <strong>air pressure!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>B </strong>- Squeeze your <strong>brakes</strong> and ensure they work, and that they work well!</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>C </strong>- Clean you <strong>chain</strong> regularly, and especially after bad weather.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Be Seen - &nbsp;Use Reflectors and Lights</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that you have reflector strips on your pedals, or wear a reflective ankle cuff on your left leg. Drivers usually have a better time recognizing bicycles at night when there is illuminated movement (reflectors on your pedals/ankles, reflectors in your wheel spokes that rotate, etc.) in addition to static lights mounted to your frame and handlebars.</li>\n<li>Invest in good-quality bike lights. Rechargeable ones tend to cost more, but they tend to be brighter. Furthermore, it may be easier to keep a charging cord at work than it is to buy batteries on a regular basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Be Heard - &nbsp;Use Bells and a Loud Voice</span> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a bell on your bike to alert pedestrians, cars, and other cyclists of your presence. Use your bell and vocal communication &ndash; ring your bell and then say, &ldquo;Passing on your left!&rdquo; when passing a pedestrian on the bike path, for example.</li>\n<li>When on bike paths, give other users as much space and forewarning as possible when passing them. It is important to share these resources gracefully!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Protect Your Head</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace your helmet every 2-3 years, and immediately after any crash in which you hit your head, or if you drop it onto hard ground from a height of four feet or more. Helmets are quite delicate, and any impact that can cause the foam to deform will severely degrade its safety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Be Smart</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you ride on the sidewalk to get to the Museum parking garage and employee bike cage, always give pedestrians the right of way. If you find this frustrating because it&rsquo;s harder to balance or it feels annoying to have to slow down to a walking pace, then it may be better to simply hop off your bike and walk it into the garage or until you are in an area where you are able to ride it comfortably and safely. Even though you&rsquo;re allowed to ride on most sidewalks in Boston, cyclists still must give pedestrians priority on sidewalks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Be Smarter &ndash; Know your Rights!</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MassBike lists your rights and responsibilities as a cyclist on their website here: <a href=\"https://www.massbike.org/laws\">https://www.massbike.org/laws</a> They describe things in everyday language, and link to the legalese content as well.</li>\n<li>Bike Safe Boston is a bicycling safety blog written by a lawyer who works with cyclists when they need legal representation. Another good resource to check for bike safety, and for what to do if you are ever in a crash <a href=\"https://bikesafeboston.com/\">https://bikesafeboston.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued commitment this month and every month for helping create a safer museum environment and for taking those good safety habits &ldquo;home&rdquo; with you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Sincerely,</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:safety_group@mos.org\">The MOS Safety Committee</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

		"messageBody": "We are looking for a forever home for our sweet 2 year old cat Bellatrix (aka Bella).  We adopted her 4 months ago to keep our other cat company after his sister passed away, but unfortunately they do not get along as we had hoped.  \n\nBella is a Scottish Fold with an impressive pedigree who was retired from having litters when we adopted her.  She has an incredibly sweet disposition, likes to play with things that roll, and is a very vocal conversationalist.  She likes to be around people and can be an aggressive snuggler.  Bella is mostly white, with some brown and black spots here and there.  She may not do well with other animals in the house, although the previous owner had no problem with having other cats and dogs around her (just our cat apparently).  She is 100% an indoor cat and would do fine in a house or apartment.\n\nWe're sad that we can't keep her and just want her to go to a loving home.  Please contact me at sheilman@mos.org or x0105 if you are interested.\n\nShe is up to date on all of her shots.  She will come with a litter box, a few toys, and a cat carrier.",

You're mentally distracted by composing the message and visually distracted by common autocorrect errors.</li>\n<li>Even at stoplights, it is important to remain an attentive driver; a AAA study shows that people are distracted up to 27 seconds after they send a voice text.</li>\n<li>7% of all drivers at any given time are using their phones while driving, but cognitive neuroscientist, <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impactful-distraction\">David Strayer</a>, says only about 2.5% of the population is actually capable of multitasking.</li>\n<li>Drivers who are talking on their cell phone are 4x more likely to crash &mdash; drunk&nbsp; drivers share those odds. The odds of crashing if you&rsquo;re texting while driving is 8x times the normal rate, meaning it<a href=\"http://www.cartalk.com/content/science-distracted-driving\"> doubles the crash likelihood</a> of driving drunk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>THREE IDEAS TO HELP CURB THIS TERRIBLE HABIT:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get your phone out of reach.</strong> Turn your phone on silent&mdash;or airplane mode&mdash; and place it in your glove compartment. If you&rsquo;re <em>still</em>&nbsp; too tempted, throw it in the trunk before getting behind the wheel.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Distract yourself&mdash;safely.</strong>Try listening to interesting radio stations, podcasts or audiobooks. None of these are as attention-absorbing as texting, which takes both your attention and your eyes off the road.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use an app to prevent use.</strong>&nbsp; Some wireless providers offer a Drive mode App, which can detect when your car is traveling, stop you from sending texts, and even send an automatic response saying you&rsquo;re driving and can&rsquo;t talk right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;Please Drive Safely this Summer and Every Day!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued commitment this month and every month for helping create a safer museum environment and for taking those good safety habits &ldquo;home&rdquo; with you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Sincerely,</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety.aspx\">MOS Safety Committee</a></p>\n<p>The National Safety Council website has lots of resources and information: <a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/pages/ddam/ddam-materials\">https://www.nsc.org/pages/ddam/ddam-materials</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/pages/nsm-public-materials\">https://www.nsc.org/pages/nsm-public-materials</a></p>",

		"messageBody": "I just received an email from my vet today about grain-free pet foods. It also mentioned that this advisory includes cats too:\n\nAs pet owners, all of us want to do what is best for our pets.  Nutrition is one of the few things that we actually have control over when it comes to their health.  Picking a food is an overwhelming landscape full of countless opinions, and savvy marketing that not only comes in the form of a commercial, but spills down to the way ingredients are listed on the label of a bag of pet food.  We want to help you navigate nutrition in general, and offer you the best science out there.\n\nCurrently, if your pet was on a listed food in the press release and is doing well, the best recommendation is to slowly transition them off over the course of a week.  We are recommending Royal Canin as they have outstanding standards for their nutrition, have a long history of safety and don't spend resources on marketing.  There are other options that you are welcome to use, but we wanted to provide at least an easy answer in the short term and we will provide you with the resources to make a choice that is best for you and your pet below.  \n\nIf you have concerns about your pet's heart health, switching foods is the most important treatment and best starting point.  If you have concerns, we are happy to help on the medical side of things and can coordinate special appointments over the next few days to listen and make sure that their hearts sound normal.  There are other ways to try and be sure that hearts are healthy such as electrocardiograms, cardiac stress blood tests and the gold standard of an echocardiogram with a cardiologist.  \n \nHere are some links from our trusted local friends at Tufts Petfoodology below to help navigate this new information from the FDA and how to move forward and continue to do the best that you can for your pet:\n \nFirst thoughts about this concept of a heart disease being linked to grain free foods coming out:\nhttps://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2018/06/a-broken-heart-risk-of-heart-disease-in-boutique-or-grain-free-diets-and-exotic-ingredients/\n \nAn update on that article above:\nhttps://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2018/11/dcm-update/\n \nHow to read between the lines on the ingredient list of a pet food:\nhttps://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2019/03/stop-reading-your-pet-food-ingredient-list/\n \nWhat to look for when picking a pet food:\nhttps://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2019/05/pna-pet-food-manufacturer-survey/\n \nThe FDA news release:\nhttp://link.vetstreetpro.com/u/nrd.php?p=IhG23yRiAR_1781709_142_-2_2&ems_l=58&l=nzzvyM44CCCcljgcmuB4gtosgrdBkzkxotgxE4tkCydkBktzy4ljgdotBkyzomgzoutdvuzktzogrdrotqdhkzCkktdikxzgotdjokzydgtjdigtotkdjorgzkjdigxjousEuvgznE&s=an6gaL8oGHUBOxxdlWbxPxhnDXI\n",

		"messageSubject": "June 2019 Comment Cards",
		"messageBody": "June 2019-Comment Cards\n\n\"Thought you should know that my family is coming down to Boston this weekend and we were looking at what to do. My son loves science, thought, of course we would go to the Museum of Science until...got stopped in my tracks by your cadaver exhibit. I remember well hearing about the awful ways the bodies were ill-begotten....some may well be executed Chinese political prisoners. All too awful for words. Cadavers coming from China should, period, never ever be an exhibit in any museum. For that matter, human cadavers should never be an exhibit, but especially with unknown sources and no clear paper-trail. So, needless to say, we will not be visiting and will encourage others to do the same. A shame really.\"\n\n\"I have noticed that on your billboard on I-90 and on your website, the Life Cycle exhibit that is returning depicts bodies with white skin. The exhibit aims to realistically show us what’s under our skin, but that skin is quite clearly white. You have an opportunity to scientifically approach the reality of black skin and of people of color. I am disappointed at this lost opportunity to educate given the scale and popularity of the exhibit. Choices matter. I have been a Premier 8 member for many years, and I’d like my commitment to science to be reflected in balanced scientific inquiry, and the thoughtful consideration of the existence, and impact of implicit bias in our daily lives.\"\n\n\"Our family has been long time members of the MoS.  I am writing to share a concern about the Body Worlds exhibit.  I appreciate the educational aspect. However, Gunther von Hagens has faced significant controversy over how he sources the bodies.  Although he claims to have certificates from where he sourced them, common sense tells you that if you follow the chain of custody all the way back to the person it is highly likely that these people were political prisoners.\"\n\n\"Greetings! I recently came across National Geographic's Planet or Plastic? exhibit, which is currently in the beginning stages of seeking hosts and putting its tour schedule together. I think the Museum would be an excellent place to bring the exhibit. You have a clear and vested interest in ecological matters and would be able to easily tie it in with ongoing exhibitions throughout the Green Wing. Additionally, a facility that literally sits on the water is the perfect location to highlight this particular issue. \nI don't know what the logistics and funding would look like, obviously, but if it is feasible for you, I would really recommend considering adding this to your rotating schedule.”\n\n\"I used to live in Boston, 2011-2012. I took the small child I cared for there many times. Came back to visit and bring my 6 yr old. Prices have increased a lot, but I didn’t t go to one single exhibit or wing that didn’t have multiple things broken. The place was so run down and completely disappointing. I will NEVER recommend this attraction to anyone!\"\n\n\"I felt compelled to write only because as a frequent visitor, I was unhappy with the rudeness of one of your staff members today. We go about weekly, but definitely twice per month and usually have very pleasant interactions. Today, that wasn't the case when We went for lunch. We eat there about 60% of the time we visit.. My Kids love eating the dino nuggets lol. This is where the trouble began. I got the nuggets with fries and a drink And a personal plain cheese pizza. The total came to 16 something.. Which I thought was high but I may have miscalculated. I asked if she billed everything separately because I had seen a sign stating there was a value meal. They didn't answer and repeated the total. I just paid.. Not that serious. then I'm trying to find a seat when a line of school children passed by bumping me and knocking my pizza and half the fries to the floor. I tried to pick up the pizza but I had my 4 year old and the tray and 2 bags... There was chaos. I asked the very same staff member if I could grab another one pointing to the pizza on the floor and they said no. That I need to be careful. I'm so disappointed in that answer. We ended up just leaving with the nuggets and salvaged fries and went to the playground instead. I just hope that the staff member was just having a bad day and isn't always so unhelpful and insensitive.\"\n\n\"I am disappointed that i was not able to find anything substantive about climate change in your museum.  The most important science issue that young people need to know about is climate change and how it will soon influence everything in their lives.  Perhaps you are not serious about teaching science to these kids and merely wish to entertain them.  Or perhaps you don't wish to annoy supporters in the fossil fuel industry.  Either way, i  expected  better.\"\n\n\"Although the discovery area is great, the visiting exhibits for young children were especially good this past winter!  We like the Dora one better than the Wild Kratz one, but having something special (that changes) that is age appropriate for young children really solves a pain point for Boston area residents who are looking for an overall experience that is friendly for adults and young children.\"\n\n\"Our family has been long time members of the MoS.  I am writing to share a concern about the Body Worlds exhibit.  I appreciate the educational aspect. However, Gunther von Hagens has faced significant controversy over how he sources the bodies.  Although he claims to have certificates from where he sourced them, common sense tells you that if you follow the chain of custody all the way back to the person it is highly likely that these people were political prisoners.\n\n\"Please bring back Mirror Maze\"\n\n\"Love birds world, however shadow puppets no longer lit properly in new location - cannot make out shapes of birds - have low vision need more contrast thanks.\"\t\n\n\"The ropes in front of the cafeteria cashiers are hard to use.\"\n\n\"I am disappointed that there is almost NOTHING on climate change! These children lives will be profoundly influenced by climate change - yet NOTHING! Not science - just entertainment. Do you get funding from the fossil fuel industry?\"\n\n\"For Red Sox weekend, will you have the demonstration of Bernoulli & ball flight, it was cool in the Science of Sports exhibit. Would love to see it again on Red Sox weekend. There was a plastic golf, baseball football & a tennis model that was put into a jet of air & we got to try it out for ourselves.\"\n\n\"A fan of the Omni Theater and laser shows, I'm merely throwing out a suggestion: Early Genesis laser show. (Early Genesis = 1970-1975, The Gabriel Years, or a mix of Prog bands: i.e. Genesis, Yes, Pink Floyd, ELP, etc. ). I know you've had success with the Pink Floyd laser shows so, I thought I'd throw it out there.\nI know I'd go!\nThanks for listening!\" \n\n\"Hi, I'm trying to see your web address for the Body Worlds and I can't see anything at https://mos.org/exhibits/body-worlds from 3 different browsers on my Apple computer. What gives?\"\n\n\"I didn't appreciate the imagery + wording used at the end of Body Worlds to describe obesity. It felt very fat-shaming in a really regressive way.\"\n\n\"I was disappointed on a recent visit to the Suit/Cabot lab.  I visited the museum last Tuesday midday.  When I got to the lab with my kids, there was only one staff member who clearly did not want to be there.  They stood in the middle of the room, greeted us, but did not engage with the kids at all. Further, I was one adult with multiple kids, and I think it was clear I could have used help in explaining things to multiple kids of different ages. In the past, staff have engaged with my kids and explained things to them.  Other times, staff have even gone so far as to help my almost 4 year old daughter use a pippette  and look through the microscope.  \nI was extremely disappointed.  I hope they were just having an off day.\"\n\n",

		"messageBody": "Over the course of July and August, Information Technology will be completely replacing our wireless network.  The goal of this project is to provide Museum employees, partners and visitors easy, anywhere, anytime access to wireless network resources and have a reliable connection wherever they are in the building. It will be a brand-new experience for wireless at the Museum!\n\nThis upgrade is necessary to improve performance and expand wireless coverage Museum-wide. It also enables us to achieve and maintain Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards and requirements that are necessary to process credit card transactions, as throughout this process we will be replacing end-of-life, legacy equipment.\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nExisting equipment will be replaced in phases by brand new wireless access points, starting with the Boston side of the building (Red & Green wing) and working our way through the Museum to the Cambridge side (Blue wing, Engineers Enclave & Gordon Wing). This staggered implementation schedule will help ensure that installation is as minimally disruptive as possible. Prior to beginning installation in any area of the building, we will be discussing the process with affected parties.\n\nWe will have a vendor on site performing access point installation, running new cables and mounting equipment. Old equipment will be removed as the new devices are installed and our new wireless networks go live.\n\nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nCabling and access point installation will officially start the week of July 29th. We will have our cabling vendor in prior to business opening to complete access point installation in public-facing areas of the building (i.e. Box Office, Omni, Planetarium, Butterfly Garden, etc.) and continuing throughout the day in office spaces. Each phase of implementation will be validated upon completion prior to moving onto the next section of the building. \n\nNew wireless networks will replace our existing MoS network names as we create new networks for our unique use cases. Staff credentials to join the wireless will remain the same (your Active Directory credentials).  \n\nFor a brief period of time, until the installation is complete, there will be dual wireless network presences with our legacy network and new wireless, but this will not impact your ability to connect or travel throughout the museum with mobile devices.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nStaff are not required to do anything during implementation.  Once we do the final cut over, staff will need to rejoin the new wireless network once per device. \n\nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please reach out to me or contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n",

This new system, Service Now, will allow us to retire the legacy Track It application and replace it with more flexible and integrated work order environment.  \n\nWe will be going live on Wed. July 17th.   \n\nThe time line for this roll out will be: \nOn Tuesday, July 16th, the current Track-it Work Order System will be taken offline.  Any new request that you need to submit that day can be emailed to ithelp@mos.org and the Service Desk will assure that a ticket is entered for you in the new system.  All active work orders will also be migrated to the new system.  \nThe new portal will be available to you starting the morning of Wednesday, July 17th at https://museumofscience.service-now.com/.    Please do not put tickets into the new system until the 17th.\nYou will sign in with your museum user name and password.  The links on the Hub will also be updated for easy navigation and access.\n\nService Now is accessible 24-7 from anywhere with an Internet connection and works across all operating systems and multiple browsers. \n\nAfter the roll-out, there will be continued growth and improvement in the platform as we get feedback and are able to implement additional functionality.  The platform has many features that we look to implementing in the future including an extensive, searchable Knowledge Base and giving more tools to the technicians, like location updates, to streamline requests and needs for the museum. \n\n*Information and Support Sessions\nThere will be 3 user drop in sessions to learn more about Service Now. \n\nDATE\tTIME\tLOCATION\nThursday, July 11th \t1pm-2pm \tEngineers Enclave\nMonday, July 15th \t11am-12pm  \tEngineers Enclave\nWednesday, July 17th \t1pm- 2pm   \tHodge\n\nIf you cannot make one of the three sessions but would still like a training session or if you have any questions or comments, please email SNAdminTeam@mos.org.\n\nWe’re very excited about rolling out this customer service platform and look forward to your feedback. \n\n\nAllison Curtis, PMP\nIIT Ops and Project Manager\nMuseum of Science\n1 Science Park \nBoston, MA 02114\nacurtis@mos.org\n",

The Forum team is launching a citizen science project on extreme heat in collaboration with the City of Boston, the City of Cambridge and the Town of Brookline.  You can read some of the details here: https://www.mapc.org/planning101/wicked-hot-boston-documenting-extreme-heat-in-the-greater-boston-area/?fbclid=IwAR0-MZqUYzGWY3ahRyR2xTwPqWU_KMJEn31alEUipMjSqh9_mUlnaDXWi_w and here: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/citizen-science-salon/2019/06/28/wicked-hot-boston-how-can-you-help-beat-extreme-heat/.   \n \nThere are two ways you can help us this weekend:\n\n1. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be going out into neighborhoods around these communities and mapping heat islands with special thermometers mounted on cars to find out where the hottest spots are located.  While we’re not quite at the point where we’ll be doing this with the general public yet, we are going to do some pilot testing on Saturday, and would love folks to join us!  The protocol involves driving around areas for an hour at 6 AM, 3 PM, and 7 PM.  You don’t have a car or a license to participate.  We’ve created a number of GSE’s for this Saturday 7/20 for various parts of the day because we’ll need help navigating and taking photos and observations while we’re traveling around, and would love for you to join us.  We’ll give you a brief training and then you’ll head out with us to test out our sensors and routes.  So please sign up on the Hub or just reach out if you’d like to help us and we’ll follow up with more details!\n \n2. Also, we’re hoping people can also go out and take pictures and make observations of how you’re all  experiencing the heatwave using an app called ISeeChange from wherever you are!.  For information on that, please go to our SciStarter project portal here: https://scistarter.org/noaa, register for an account, and start sharing your observations on ISeeChange!  This is something that everyone can do, so please spread the word to friends and family no matter where they might be.\n \nThanks – if you have questions, please email me, Katie Baur, or Sara Benson and we’d love to answer them.  Stay cool this weekend!\n\nDavid",

		"messageBody": "<b><u>Summary</u></b>\nAfter performing a year-end analysis of benefits costs versus salaries, we are changing the benefit rates in the payroll system for FY20.\n\n<b><u>New Rates</u></b>\nThe new rates are:\n•\tExecutive Rate: 16% (unchanged)\n•\tFull-time: 24% (was 25%)\n•\tPart-time: 23% (was 19%)\n•\t430(B) Only: 11.5% (was 9%)\n\n<b><u>Budget Impact</u></b>\nWe will NOT be changing the approved FY20 department budgets to reflect the new rates – too complicated to do this late in the budget-loading process.  As the year goes on, we will be mindful of instances where the new rates cause a department to go over budget through no fault of its own.  This should only happen in departments that are part-time-heavy – most departments should, if anything, experience slight budget savings from the change.\n\n<b><u>Grant Impact</u></b>\nWe will be updating the official GPC budget template to reflect the new rates, though this may take a while thanks to Audit.  For anyone with a grant proposal already in the works, Christa and Lindsay will fix the budgets by hand.  If you start a new proposal before the template is updated, let me or Lindsay know and we will fix your copy of the template and send it back to you.\n\nBecause of this change in rates, please discard all old blank templates you may have saved on your computer or network share.  Once it’s updated, the official one on the Hub GPC page will be the only valid version.\n",

Same as our existing public with a slightly new look.\nAs the installation progresses there will be updates on coverage zones for everyone, while we work directly with the people in the areas in which we’re currently working.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nAlmost nothing. Once you’ve joined the new SSIDs your devices will automatically switch to what’s available as you move through the building. While the install is underway there will be a dual presence of both our legacy wireless networks and our new wireless networks, but this should not impact your ability to connect to or use either.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n\nThanks,\nRae\n",

Once the access point is mounted, any cabling materials will be cleared out and we will move onto the next location. \n\nWhat Is the Timeline?\n•\tWeek of 8/12: Continuing installation through corridor, loading dock, café, and Green Wing.\n•\tWeek of 8/19: Continuing if necessary, otherwise starting work in the next closet (2nd floor, Boston Side).\n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nBasically nothing.

We are very close to finishing the Boston side of the Museum!\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nWe will be working in these areas either early in the morning prior to opening with our vendor, pulling new cables and mounting access points for our new wireless network. A lot of the work will be in the hallways and along the cable pathway to get wiring in place from our network closet to the wireless access point locations. Some of the work will be in office spaces and exhibits to mount them to ceilings and walls as necessary. We will be working to make sure we are out of public facing spaces before Museum open and minimize disruption to your everyday work life. We also have detailed floor plans of access point locations if you need further clarification on installation areas. Once the access point is mounted, any cabling materials will be cleared out and we will move onto the next location. \n \nWhat Is the Timeline?\n•\tStart roughing in the 4th floor cabling today (8/20).\n•\tWork on Body Worlds (2nd floor) tomorrow (8/21).\n•\tComplete 2nd and 4th floor AP installation Thursday-Friday.\n•\tWe may start on 6th floor this week, depending on how quickly we can progress through some of the trickier office spaces.\n \nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nBasically nothing. But if you have a scheduling issue and there is a day it would be highly inconvenient for our cabling team to be in your area, please let us know so we can work around your schedule. We will be coordinating with each department to minimize disruption and schedule access.\n \nOur service desk team will be available to help users join the new wireless networks (Staff@MoS, Public@MoS, etc.), and as you move through the Museum your connection should not be interrupted as both networks will be available until the installation is completed for the entire building.\n \nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n \nThanks,\nRae\n",

		"messageSubject": "August 2019 Comment Card Report",
		"messageBody": "August 2019 Comment Card Report\n\n\"1. Interesting talk on climate change but words too big for kids.\n2. suggest a speaker instead of the telephones. too many germs & need volume control so 2 kids can listen at once\"\n\n\"I was a member 10 years ago when my daughter was young, was always fun. After a 10 year hiatus I decided to take my 11 year old nephew to the museum for his first time. I have to say I am shocked to see such open unused floor and wall space especially on the 1st level, and 2nd- level where the optical illusions are. It's very disappointing! My nephew is 11, he was bored. Most if not all the hands on exhibits are geared towards ages 8 and under. With todays tech and leaps in science, you really need more current exhibits. how bout future tech?  I must say that todays visit(8-2-19)has seriously deterred me and my family from going to the museum of science for a long long time. Also,If youre going to have reduced amount of exhibits, you should lower exhibit hall pricing to compensate for the lack thereof.\"\n\n\"We had the best time at Astronomy After Hours tonight! We enjoyed being able to use many different types of telescopes and seeing some planets! Steve and Kaylen were so helpful with the telescopes and sharing their passions for the stars! Ted was so full of information and we loved learning from him!! This was our first time at this event and we will definitely be back!!\"\n\n\"We had a wonderful experience, especially because of the time and consideration that Janet Nova took to help our visit. We had four guests with us (for a total of eight people), and she went through the time and effort to calculate out for us how much we would actually save by becoming members at the premiere 8 level. She was patient and definitely helped start our day off on a great foot! Thank you for such amazing attention.\"\n\n\"I just got home from the telescope program at the museum and had to write a review right away! This program was amazing and we learned so much!! Kayla taught us constellations while we waited in line and was so nice and welcoming. Steve greeted us as friends and John showed us Saturn. This program is so well done and it was a perfect night for us. Thank you!!\"\n\n\"In the early fifties, when I lived In Milford, i sent an object to the Museum which I thought might be a meteorite. It was not, but I was asked if the Museum could keep it for an exhibit on meteorites and things that were mistaken for meteorites.\nI was wondering if you still have any record in your database of this item. I’m visiting the Museum next week with my son and his family (museum members) and it would be a treat if I and my grandchildren could actually see this item after nearly seventy years.  \nPlease let me know what you find. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Why after watching the server make Mac and cheese with elbow noodles in a big pan why does he tell me I can’t have the elbow noodles with red sauce instead of the cheese sauce? His reason is “we only use the noodles for the Mac and cheese “ What!? \nFood service - if it’s available, and asked for, you should serve it.\nBeing a member for many years and not happy the last two times we bought food, we’ll be bringing our own food from now on\nHorrible customer service!\"\n\n\"Cafe needs to be able to offer other roll options other than the wheat one that comes with grilled items. I don’t eat the wheat roll and when asked for chicken sandwich on something other than wheat I was given the chicken on a plate and charged for a sandwich . What?! Cafe needs to be a bit more flexible\"\n\n\"1. No gluten free products in any of food area. I shouldn't be restricted to buying only a salad, or bag of chips or banana.\n2. We got Dippin' Dots outside the Riverview Cafe. When we finished, there was no where to put our plastic cups and plastic spoons except in the trash - no re-cycling bins.\n3. There is only one gender-neutral bathroom, and its in the museum, and when thats closed there is none.\"\n\n\"I am such a big fan of the planetarium music experiences! I have been to a couple and I cannot wait to come back to watch more! I would like to suggest the band OneRepublic that would be great for this experience - I would like more information on who to contact to make this happen! Thank you so much.\"\n\n\"Vegan food options would be greatly appreciated!\"\t\n\n\"We were at the museum yesterday, and ate lunch at the cafeteria. We were surprised at how noisy it was, and I happen to have a dB Meter on my phone. When I used the meter, it was approximately 95 dB each time, which for a customer in the short time that they are there is not a problem, but this may be a problem for your employees. It is my understanding that prolonged exposure to 90 or more decibels is an OSHA violation\"\n\n\"I was a science explorer in the 1950's and now live in Colorado. I am sitting at the computer listening to a great horned owl calling from a tree somewhere close by and remembering Spooky. I wanted to tell you how much the program meant to me in the past and now.\nWhen I logged onto your website to find out where to write to you, the picture on the homepage reminded me of the transparent woman. I remember that the opening of the exhibit was delayed while the descriptive recording was remade. The original had such a heavy German accent that it was deemed too difficult for us New Englanders to understand.\nOur whole family bought stars to help open the planetarium. I hope the list is still in existence somewhere.\nThank you again!\"\n\n\"Good Morning:  I was watching your Body of Work commercials and realized how gender oriented they were.  The female body is taking a selfie and the male is batting a baseball. Please share with the marketing staff that this is inappropriate in this day and age.  I am a female athlete, a doctor and scientist.  Selfies are not the focus of me.  We can do better than this, especially with an ad for an esteemed museum where young children can be influenced, especially young girls. Especially young girls that we are trying to encourage to be part of STEM studies and careers.  Please consider revising the ads.  Thank you very much for your time.\"\n\n\"In the Human Body exhibit, there was some excessively heteronormative language. In one part it says “the fathers sperm and the mother’s egg.” There is no reason to included that gendered language. You could just say “sperm and egg.” As someone in a queer family I don’t like that because some people use “they” and that might not make them comfortable. It also erases families like mine. \n\n\"I renewed our membership a couple of weeks ago. We went to the museum for the first time since 2017.\nI have to say I found it really disturbing to see you were selling alcoholic beverages in the cafe. \nThis I thought, was a family oriented place. I really do not believe alcohol serves any purpose in this environment. I truly hope you will rethink this action. We live in a society that is plagued with addiction. We need to be able to visit places where we are not reminded of the pain of this addiction.\nThanks so much for your attention to this matter.\"\n\n\"None of the phone options make sense...\nWhen you call, here are the options, and none of them are for tickets:\nFor membership line press 1\nFor school and groups reservations press 2\nFor recorded information press 3\nFor events and conference services department (not tickets) press 4\nFor public safety press 5\nNow do you see why calling on the phone makes me feel like an idiot? \nSomeone needs to redo your phone system.\"\n\n\"Hi there. We just brought our family through the planetarium for the magic tree house show and were very excited to have our kids learn about space in such an immersive environment. Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the lack of diversity reflected in the show. \nEvery single human represented in that show was white, and in a story reflecting the diversity of space and our planet this lack of representation of human diversity was shocking and unfortunate. \nI hope the museum considers adopting another show that better reflects the diversity of our planet so the many types of people walking in the door get to see themselves represented in this important story.\" \n\n\"Why are you charging $1.60 for a cheesestick and not have a sign for the price? Nice place though.\"\n\"The food in your cafe is beyond horrible. Shame on you foe the quality and the dirty conditions.\"\n\n\"As a past member I have enjoyed all the great experiences the facility has to offer. In recently came down to update and pay for my membership and I brought two guests who are pre-med students to seen the Body Worlds exhibit with me, I had seen the exhibit when it came to the museum about 11 or 12 years ago multiple times. When I came last week I must say that we were a bit disappointed with the amount of pieces in the exhibit. I know things on tours change but it was nothing that compared to the previous exhibit. There were many bodies that I spoke to the students about that were not onsite. I do enjoy coming to the site and supporting the museum with my visits and membership but if I had known it was a smaller show i am not sure what i would have done paying extra for the exhibit. Thank you for your time, it is appreciated.\" \n\"super-fun, immediately engaging but very chaotic (children running room to room \"\"doing things\"\" without knowing/learning).  I know it's supposed to be \"\"cool-er than school\"\".  Lastly, we were there for THREE hours and of the 3 floors/6 wings, we covered 2.  To think the museum requires 3 DAYS to complete, the price is quite off-putting. Also many seemingly interesting exhibits for which one would have to pay extra?!\" \n\"I am a French Paris science teacher (middle-school and high school) and I had this summer the opportunity to visit your great museum. I visited Boston with my husband and my 3 kids and we visited the Museum of Science. We used the Boston city pass to get into the museum. We didn't understand the museum closed at 5:PM and nobody told us at the entrance access we will only have 1 hour of visit. The museum is awesome and very interesting. We were very disappointed to visit it only one hour.\nWhen we went out, I came to see the cashier and the welcome desk to ask if it was possible to return the day after with free tickets as we visited only one hour. The cashier said to me that they could not do something for us because we had City Pass. It was a pity for us.\nNevertheless, the museum gave me ideas for my French students especially the yellow giant height gauge which shows the difference between angstroem and feet (I can send you a picture of my daughter next to the gauge).\nI would like to buy the same gauge as yours for my highschool but in meter/micrometer/nanometer.\nCoul you give me the name of your supplier of this gauge ?\"\n\n\"Why must one purchase a ticket for the Exhibit Halls if they just want to see Body Worlds?  Tickets are expensive enough for a temporary exhibit, let alone having to pay for the permanent Exhibit Halls when you don't want to explore them, or worse, when you've just seen them and a new temporary exhibit comes and you want to see that as well.  You know when Boston museums are too expensive when someone from California tells you that it's cheaper to do things in California than it is in Massachusetts.\"\n\n\"The Body Works Exhibit is, in my opinion, hideous & unethical. Also, the 3 year old I care for is very frightened of the ads o the T. I may not renew my membership over this\"\n\n\"We had a wonderful time at the Museum today taking in the Body Works Exhibit and the Great Bear Rainforest Show, and at the end of the day we became members. \nI noted with great interest the display in the gift shop talking about the disgraceful accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans and elsewhere. Upon entering the cafeteria I was surprised to see that the only soda, etc. containers were single use plastic. I know that plastic containers are \"\"recyclable\"\" but to the best of my knowledge there is no market for them, so the only choices are to bury them in the earth or toss them in the waterways.\nMy question is, could the plastic bottles be replaced with aluminum containers which could then be truly recycled and help us to protect the environment? \nThanks for your consideration\"\n\n\"EBT card, entry free had best time at the Planetarium. Thank you for helping my son \"\"expend his mind.\"\" Very generous. He is an exceptional learner, had a great time!\"\n\n\"From time I put Premier Membership 2 in my cart and checked you on Charity Navigator to see whether I wanted to donate a larger gift to your organization, it took all of the 20 minutes you allowed. Had I had maybe five more minutes, I would not have had to start all over again.  Now I will just order the membership but you make it hard to do a gift membership as I have to start all over again.\"\n\n\"Hi!  My family and I took the lovely member cruise this morning and I wanted to give you some feedback about it since I overheard an MOS employee talking about how this morning was the best attended despite many marketing attempts.\nI happened to see it in the email that went out on Thursday but that was the first time I saw it. Then when I went online to get the tickets it was very difficult to find it (the link sent you to a page but then you had to sign into your MOS account and wouldn’t return you to the ticketing page directly, so it was a lot of fumbling around on the website). \nMy aunt also came with us - but I bought her ticket - shes an MOS member too and loves things like this and said she had never heard of it.\nWe were both really surprised that there had been a lot of attempts to make members aware of it.  We had a great time so I just wanted to let you know that the marketing attempts may not have 'landed'  like you expected, and may not be a reflection of the actual interest in the program.\nI love your programming and thought the feedback may be helpful!\"\n\n\"New member ( premier) and did not receive 2 hours of free parking which I thought was a benefit!\nPlease help\"\n\n\"Hello!I am emailing you because i have 2 boys whom are both science fanatics! Both of them are straight A student's and in Gifted classes! They both study very hard.They are always making something whether it be slime or a stress ball or a volcano it is never a dull moment in our house!My kitchen,front porch and their bedroom stays in a mess lol but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Anyways the reason I am writing is because i was wondering if you could possibly send them a fan pack from your museum with a science kit or t-shirt or hat or stickers or all of the above? We encourage our boys to be whatever they want to be and always put their studies first! We are super proud of them! Thank you so much for your time and we look forward to hearing/receiving some things from you guys !Have a beautiful blessed day!\"\n\n\"It is my understanding that neither you, nor anyone else, has informed consent agreements from the donors that can be linked to the bodies and body parts on display in 'Body Worlds' (https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687).  The explanation I have seen is that this is to protect the anonymity and confidentiality of the donors, but it makes it impossible to independently confirm that such informed consent exists.  I also understand the bodies come from Dr. Gunther von Hagens, who also sources bodies from China, a known violator of human rights, and who has sourced bodies from a Russian convicted of illegally trafficking in bodies and body parts, although von Hagens claims none of the 'Body Worlds' bodies come from these tainted sources - a claim which cannot be verified given the lack of documentation (https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687).  I also understand (from the 'FAQs' on your exhibition website) that you rely on others to vet the obvious, serious ethical concerns raised ('a distinguished committee of theologians, ethicists, academics and medical luminaries.... California Science Center.... the City of Heidelberg, Germany').  Am I correct in my understanding?\"\n\n\"Visitor leaving the observatory at Astronomy After Hours: \"'My son wanted a drone. Now he wants a telescope instead.'\"\n\n\"I do NOT like the automatic hand stamper. It presses too firmly. I have slim hands - all bones - OUCH! Possibly rolled my skin over bone pinching me.\"\n\n\"Hi! I wanted to express my sadness today at the museum. We drove about 1.5 hours (back and forth) to visit and watched 4D Splash and Bubbles. However, the experience was nothing like it was before. There were barely any bubbles, music, no splash, except for some very uncomfortable lower leg puffs. This is very different from all the others we have seen so far. I think there was some machine malfunctioning going on. \nWill someone address this issue?\"\n",

Thank you\"\n\n\"It would be great to have the Lewis and Clark Expedition film open to the public instead of only schools.   I am a former educator and would love to see it and  take my grandchildren to see it some time.\"\n\n\"Your cafe really needs some attention.  The floors are sticky, the tables are not clean.  The chairs are a mess (I got a splinter when pulling the chair into the table).  School cafes are cleaner that your facility.  Whole place needs to be refreshed\"\n\n\"Hi there, I just wanted to note that it's really difficult to determine how long the temporary exhibits run when viewing information on the mobile site. (Possibly the desktop version too, but I've only viewed on mobile). The only way I could determine the run for the Body Worlds exhibit was to try to book tickets as far in advance as possible until it wouldn't allow me to. It would be much more convenient if the site just listed run dates alongside temporary exhibit information so patrons can plan their visit accordingly. It would help on the train ads, too but those are what they are at this point. Still effective since it lead me to investigate! Thank you\"\n\n\"I joined as a member today. I took my family to see Great Barrier Reef today 2 pm show. We were disappointed in the show. First, we thought we'd see more information about the fish and other creatures along the reef, a la David Attenborough. Instead, it was a travelogue for the eco-tourism place and too much about the lady who blogs. Most of the movie was looking at her, on a boat, or taking pictures under water. We wanted to see what she took for pictures, not her taking them. No information about how she learned to free dive so well. Or info on the fish. What were we looking at?  And some of the video looked liked stock video.  Speaking of video, the movie was out of focus, there was an awful echo in the voices, and the movie did not fit the screen. I so disappointed in the quality of this show, not up to MoS standards. My grandchildren even noticed the poor quality. I wasted four passes on this movie, Please do better.\"\n\n\"We renewed our membership.  However, we did not have a chance to use the 4 free planetarium passes before they expired.  Is there anyway to get these 4 passes credited to our account to use this coming year?\"\n\n\"The Restrooms and the food court is very dirty, _not_ well taken care of.\"\n\n\"Climate change show - presenter was very animated but content was awfully 'lecture-y' - suggest using Sammy Sosa steroid analogy _first_ - get audience to see data and then attribute his rise in home runs to steroids. THEN use similar data to get them to predict climate change. End was good, but took a _long_ time to get there.\"\n\n\"I do not want the electronic passes to expire because I would like to use them. I come here a lot with my family, therefore it makes more sense.\"\n\n\"I don't want the electronic passes to expire because I want to use them regularly. I also have food allergies and would like that the food services are more allergen friendly. (allergy safe towards peanuts, tree nuts, soy, shellfish, fish, sesame, milk, eggs)\"\n\n\"(1) Electronic passes should not expire\n(2) Top 8 allergen free food bar. I am anaphylactic to peanuts, tree nuts + soy you need to address top 8 allergens thank you\"\n\n\"The electronic passes. I Don't like it that they expire. We need a food alergy freindly section in the food cort please.\"\n\n\"One of the issues I have with many of your exhibits is that when you look at them closely, your shadow blocks the exhibit.\"\n\n\"Mary, in visitor services was EXTREMELY helpful, pleasant, and a pleasure to work with. She embodies exactly who should be a visitor services representative. Thank you!!!\"\n\n\"Dear Scot, My granddaughter Samantha and I thoroughly enjoyed the member overnight. Could not have been better. Please let Julie and all the overnight staff know she and they did a great job. Samantha is only 8 and generally goes to bed at 8:00 PM; staying up to midnight might be difficult, so we decided to scientifically count her yawns, but she was so excited, entertained and enthralled, it turned out to be a zero yawn overnighter!\nThank you again.\"\n\n\"You are an institute of science. Stop insisting or allowing your employees to announce their pronouns during shows. This is a huge insult to science.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the Climate Talk. Please suggest that visitors call their US Representatives + Senators + endorse HR763, a carbon fee + dividend act. Maybe even make an exhibit about political solutions?\"\n\n\"You are a science museum but are negatively impacting the environment by selling water in plastic bottles.\"\n\n\"I see that it was done in the past. It's very disappointing that the event was discontinued.\"\n\n\"I was trying to get a ticket, but suddenly the price changed from $34 to $37 when the time is not the day of the exhibition. I would like to know how your system works with the cut down time to get advanced tickets discount. Thanks!\"\n\n\"When will your ads of skinned corpses (Body Worlds) no longer be in places where hundreds of thousands of people are exposed to them everyday? Words cannot begin to describe how insensitive and inappropriate these ads are. They can be triggering to victims of violent, morbid events. You could have advertised just as effectively with DRAWINGS of skinned corpses, instead of photos. \nHow did you all get permission to post these photos? Aren’t their laws governing the types of images people may post as advertisements so that way respectable people aren’t forced to look at insensitive things like this? (And, btw, the fact people donated their corpses doesn’t make this any less shameful... not when people— including children!— are exposed to your morbid advertisements on a daily basis.)\"\n\n\"I am writing to express my disappointment in your pricing system for the Body Worlds exhibit. As a family of three who relies on an EBT card to visit MOS, to discover that not only would we have to pay separate admission for this exhibit, but that the “discount” would amount to $15 per person, I was absolutely dismayed that the MOS, which should be a place for all children regardless of socioeconomic status, would be so exclusionary. At $45, there is no way that I as a single mother, can afford this. Just paying for the parking garage is a stretch for me and many other families in our situation. You have cut off access to an exhibit that my children were looking forward to seeing. To exclude those who can’t even afford regular admission smacks nothing short of discrimination. Shame on MOS.\"\n\n\"I have to express disappointment with your pricing for the Body Worlds exhibit for EBT recipients. I understand to a point that you have to charge for this exhibit, but at $15 per person for a family of three it is completely impossible. Single mothers like myself come here as a treat. Even though we don’t pay for general admission, just the parking cost alone makes this museum a once in a blue moon experience. I urge anyone associated with the policy to reconsider as it promotes exclusion to those who are of a certain socioeconomic class. MOS should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such thoughtless discrimination.\"\n\n\"Your cafe needs attention.  The place was a mess.  No clean tables, food left behind on them, food spilled all over the floors (accident waiting to happen).  Walls look like they have never been cleaned, food stains on them - gross!  Your salad bar needs to be checked for freshness - lettuce i got was brown on the edges.  The line to pay was very confusing, People cutting in front of others.  Set up cue line like Disney - they are able to user thousands of guests with no issues and they are bigger than this place\"\n\n\"We had a wonderful time in the Discovery Center with Kelle! Our son took an immediate liking to her and she was so kind & patient playing with him! Thanks, Kelle!\"\n\n\"Beyonce experience - I've been to 6+ Planetarium music shows, and this by far was the most underwhelming one yet. By far. (low quality, not syncronized, too bright, boring!) So sad!\"\n\n\"We saw the Beyonce Experience today and it was terrible, wildly disappointing. The screen was not calibrated, the music and images were out of sync, images did not fit the vibe of music. It felt like I watched a high school project. Beyonce would be disappointed!!\"\n\n\"First, I wanted to commend you on providing so much mobility equipment for visitor use. Using a mobility scooter allowed me to see much more than I could have. Thank you!\nI did want to give two suggestions:\n1) providing a chair near the info desk to sit in while people wait for scooters etc. would be a great help.\n2) In the Bodyworlds exhibit, there are two sets of closed doors to navigate, and they aren't automatic. I tried to open them from the scooter, but had great difficulty until another visitor came to my aid. Please consider this aspect of accessibility for exhibits with closed doors in them.\"\n\n\"Visited  as a Senior with my 12 year old grandson yesterday to experience together the heavily promoted Body Worlds exhibit.\nHis ticket cost was $37 and mine $33.\nWe were told these prices included a second exhibit which we not able to decline.  Both of us enjoyed the exhibit, we could not locate the second event, which was not the reason for our attending.\nWe were given after payment of $70 cash:\nExhibit Halls Package Adult (Vch) for $22.00 and Package Senior (Vch) for $18.00\nBODY WORLDS:  The Cycle of Life\n [2] Add-on Adult at $15.00 each\nI am wondering why your banner - blitz all over the city did no show the distinction.\nThe day before we two experienced [1] The Codzilla speed boat ride with my grandsons father. And the day before, my grandson and I visited the Aquarium. \nI am not seeking a refund, just ticket sellers better equipped at explaining the pricing structure.\"\n\n\"There is nothing on the website that states what is and/or isn't allowed to be brought in to the museum.\" \n\"Astronomy After Hours\nI learned so much\nThe Best\nPlease always stay open\"\n\n\"Activities, especially tardigrades under a microscope are wonderful - especially since we were somewhat stranded because of the rainstorm (Astronomy After Hours)\"\n\n\"When you resume discounted memberships for people with academic appointments I’ll consider rejoining.\"\n\n\"The bathrooms in the concourse were in terrible state when we arrived at 7:30 pm so I reported it to the Info Desk. At 9:30 when we were leaving, the bathroom floors had been mopped but the wasted baskets were still overflowing with papertowels and the toilet paper was still on the floor.\"\n\n\"When I pulled up to the parking garage ticket dispenser (on the right side), I somehow hit my car against a cement post or something when pulling away from the ticket machine! I was not even that close to the machine when I pulled up. Is this a problem for others besides me? I am not a careless driver, so I think somehow the ticketing machine is not spatially set up properly! As a result, my car was dented & scratched along the side. I'm very upset that this happened & think something should be done about this.\"\n\n\"I am visiting from Uganda and I enjoyed the Musuem of Science ,I wish there was a way I could volunteer for the two months I am down here,back at home we do not have a museum of science. I am 15 years old and I very passionate about science that's for sure.\nI do biology and chemistry,I dropped physics because it just was not the same as when I used to live back in England where I felt like physics was daily life.\nThank you Musuem of Science.”\n\n\"My family (me, my husband, our 19-year-old daughter & her boyfriend, and our four-year-old son) recently went to the MOS for a day, traveling from RI. The entire visit was stunning and exciting, but I am writing to praise a particular member of your staff. At the live animal presentation, a person named Sara(h) came out to teach us about snakes and common rats. Her enthusiasm was contagious and she handled her animals and her audience well. She also led with her pronouns (“My name is Sara and my pronouns are she/her/hers”). As a gender-nonconforming person myself and as an educator who trains on anti-bias work, I wanted to be sure that Sara and the MOS know that her introduction made me feel more welcome and was an unexpected and lovely moment during our visit. Please pass on our thanks - for her thoughtfulness and her impeccable rat-handling.\"\n\n\"Faulty Bee Display\nThe Bee display in the Human Body exhibit is a death trap for Bees. They are DYING Horrible Dealths! Please FIX ASAP\"\n\"Thank you for a wonderful experience! Your volunteers are OUTSTANDING. One suggestion: caption the lightning demo for ESL folks - they do this at the opera.\"\n\n\"Could you make an exhibit about basketball? I think there might be science in it, but I don't know what.\"\n\n\"Please pass this on to Nicole in the human life exhibit. I just wanted to let you know what a great job she did with sharing information on the organs. It was amazing! She was very engaging and intelligent. It was the highlight of my trip to the museum. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Jordan at the ticket counter was wonderful! Very attentive flagged that membership was more economical after I placed my order - not pushy but knowledgeable & patient\"\n\n\"I tried multiple times to buy a guest membership. Website kept insisting that it was a \"duplicate email\". I literally created the email 2 weeks ago. Nobody has touched your site with this email. \nSorry I will simply buy elsewhere. Your web people really need to fix this.\"\n",

Still requires VPN for most internal resources.\n•\tPublic@MoS – guest wireless, web traffic ONLY. Join via splash screen.\n•\tEvents@MoS – wireless network for Museum functions only, password protected.\n\nThis project would not have been possible without the much appreciated assistance of Archives, Collections, Event & Conference Services, Exhibit Maintenance, Facilities, Omni, Planetarium, Public Safety, Visitor Services, and Wolfgang Puck. Your guidance, information sharing, and cooperation have been key components in getting our new wireless equipment installed as quickly and efficiently as possible. Everyone who made time to work with us and our vendors really helped move the project along, enabling us to achieve a successful outcome. And everyone in the rest of IT for working with schedule adjustments and helping re-allocate resources as needed while wireless work took priority, thank you for your support.\n\nA huge thank you to Carousel and Connectivity Point, our project vendors, for their tireless efforts and dedication to a successful project completion. We would not have been able to complete this work without their expertise. And finally, thank you to everyone for your patience and cooperation during this project, it has been very much appreciated. \n\nEnjoy the new wireless experience at the Museum!\n\n-Rae\n",

Together, we are contributing our organizational expertise to accelerate the impact of sustainable initiatives to address the systemic injustices associated with food insecurity.\n \nIn Massachusetts, 1 in 11 people is food insecure.  The number rises to 1 in 9 nationally. \n \nMany families and individuals do not have reliable access to affordable healthy food, leading to preventable negative health consequences. According to a study released by The Greater Boston Food Bank and Children’s HealthWatch in 2018, the avoidable health care cost of hunger in Massachusetts is $2.4 billion. \n \nAs a member of the Hunger to Health Collaboratory, we are part of a diverse group of industry leaders working to address the systemic injustices associated with food insecurity.\n \nIn November, the Museum of Science will host The Hunger to Health Summit where leaders from across the country will convene to discuss the various actions that we can take to raise awareness and take collective action to reduce food insecurity. \n \nFor more information about this initiative, please contact Susan Heilman or more information online, visit: https://www.gbfb.org/what-we-do/hunger-to-health-collaboratory/ \n \n",

		"messageBody": "Good morning,\n\nAs previously communicated, the Museum received a donation from Dell EMC for a new storage device.  This has enabled the Museum to improve how we manage, store, and backup much of our unstructured content. \n \nWhat Does This Mean?\nInformation Technology will use the new device to replace our existing Zeus file server.  Over the past few months, we have been working with users on unencrypting files and folders that prevented us from transitioning over to this device last summer.   We are happy to report that we will finalize the migration of all Zeus shared folders and home directories on October 7th  starting at 6pm. \n \nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nDo not panic! We will be retaining all file and folder permissions and will be retaining the existing “Zeus” naming convention in order to maintain how users currently connect to shared resources.\n \nFor PC/Windows users, this will not introduce any changes to the way you connect to your Zeus shares.  However, Mac users that do not currently connect to Zeus via the SMB connection (i.e CIFS) will need to be remapped before or on the morning of 10/8/19 in order to access the shares.  Our service desk will be ready to help with this change and you should contact us immediately for assistance.\n \nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nIn order to prepare for the final migration of data to the new device we ask that users close out of all shared museum file directories and personal work drives when leaving at night leading up to October 7th so that we can continue to copy files over daily.  On the night of October 7th all files and folders on Zeus need to be closed before 6pm so that IT can work with Dell EMC and maximize our final migration window.  If files and folders are not closed out, IT will close them to ensure that the data is properly migrated to the new device.  To avoid losing changes to files please close out of all files and folders promptly before 6pm.\n\nPlease note that staff should not store non-work related items (music, personal photos, videos, etc.) on Zeus shared museum file directories and home directories, in keeping with the Museum’s Technology Resource Policy. This will help us keep up with the demand for storage needs and retain a longer backup retention policy for museum related work needs.  In the future, if you need additional storage capacity for your home directory, you can call the service desk or submit a request online.\n \nAs always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.\n\nAngela\n",

The theme for the month this year is, ‘Own IT. Secure IT. Protect IT.’ because keeping the digital world secure requires all of us to be proactive and diligent.\n\nTo that end, Information Technology will be leading an informal campaign to help raise the Museum's awareness about the importance of cybersecurity both at work and at home.  Each week, a member of the IT staff will share tips and tools that we can all use to protect the Museum's data as well as personal information.

		"messageBody": "September 2019 Comment Cards\n\n“Please offer vegan options in the cafe. Grilled tofu in the salad bar or sandwiches with grilled veggies and tofu. Hummus wraps with veggies. Lots of options!\"\n\n\"I visited the Museum of Science again yesterday as part of Brandeis University's Orientation for First-Year students. I was primarily interested in seeing how the museum is presenting the science of climate change. I asked at the entrance where I would find the section on climate science. But I was told that there was none. That I might find information about climate change sprinkled into the basic science sections, but there was no single room or section devoted to climate science. I was told that on normal days presenters would talk about extreme weather and meteorological questions as part of their presentations, but presentations are not part of the evening program. \nThis came as a shock to me, given the seriousness of the climate crisis, and the urgent need for young people to be educated about the science, the problems, and the solutions. I would like to know what the museum leadership is planning to do to address this dangerous vacuum. Is a major exhibit about climate science in the works? If not, why not? I would assume that MathWorks, your main sponsor, is sympathetic to such a project? Given how many young people are getting involved in climate activism, providing them with a solid basis of the scientific facts seems paramount.\"\n\n\"Starbucks shouldn’t be cleaning their machines 3 hrs before they close, it’s not the customers fault they don’t manage their time efficiently.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know when our membership expires but I can't find it on the website.  Can you help?  Thank-you.\"\n\n\"We are hoping the IMAX movie, \"Superpower Dogs\" is coming to the MoS.  We saw it in LA and it's absolutely fabulous.  We really hope you consider bringing it to Boston!\"\n\n\"Change your air filters in planetarium. You have a mold problem! Fix it soon or it will get a lot worse.\"\n\n\"A science museum without gyroscopes for sale is like an art museum without postcards of artwork.\"\n\n\"Hi. We used to use one of your sites to learn forces using the website:  http://legacy.mos.org/etf/force.html.  Apparently it is a retired website.  Do you have another website that can be used?\"\n\"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, as always\"\n\n\"My 4 yr old grandson entrusted his dinosaur Penny to Papa- who lost it?? Is there a way I could purchase another Thanks so much for all you do there ??\"\n\n\"You should provide paper cups in the cafe for water, instead of plastic. Protect the earth!\"\n\n\"You keep sending me notices to complete application, and the link that you provide does not worked. I took a screen shot and mailed it to you and my email came back as NO REPLY. If you are only interested in one way communication I am requesting to withdraw my application.\"\n\n\"I took my grandson to the museum yesterday. Before leaving for the day, I stopped by Starbucks to get a coffee. I have never had such bad service in my life.  Two staff members behind the counter, one could not see me the other was eating food out of the container their own food, if looks could kill I would be dead now. Gave them my order a latte and an ice cream, paid for the order they then waited on two to three no problem, thinking the other person was making my coffee.  The staff member goes back to eating their food. Asked them where my latte was, they said they never waited on me. I went to get my sales slip to show them. Again another look to kill.  I am so upset I will NEVER go back to the museum. Please take this up with the Starbucks manager so this doesn't happen to another customer. MS has lost my business because of this.\"\n\n\"I wanted to share a wonderful experience that happened last night. Three of my friends and myself went to the museum of science in Boston to see the moon through telescopes. One of my friends has muscular dystrophy and cannot move any limb so he is completely wheelchair bound. \nWe came to where the telescopes were set up and noticed that there were long lines at each on that was already set up on the grass and on the sidewalk. We were doubting if he was going to be able to participate until one of the workers who introduced himself as Steve came over and said that he was going to take care of us. \nSteve walked away briskly into the building and within 10 minutes he was back with a telescope that he was setting up to specifically accommodate my friend Nick in his wheelchair. Steve was very patient and enthusiastic about helping us which we couldn’t thank him enough. All four of us, but most importantly Nick, got to enjoy and see the moon crystal clear through the telescope. \nI’m sending this email to put spotlight on Steve and let him know how much we appreciated his extra effort to help and accommodate Nick without us even asking. He made the experience that much more memorable. Steve is a wonderful and kind person and I hope he will be recognized for his thoughtful actions.\"\n\n\"Very interesting. Friendly informative staff in Hands-on Lab.\" \n\n\"My 4 yr old grandson and I visited the museum this morning, and eventually had a great visit, as we usually do. Because his family has a membership I take him several times a year. \nWe arrived and wanted to get a bite to eat before beginning exhibits. We proceeded to the cafe area where I could get coffee (I thought)---several groups of school children were purchasing lunches in the cafeteria, and many then went to the Starbucks area for drinks, I guess. Very bad timing on our part, as we ended up behind about 20 students.....with 1 person at the cashier---I was not able to get to her for an hour. During that time, we went to the other area and got something for my grandchild and sat there. We returned and I had to wait for 15 minutes behind about 7 children. \nBelieve it or not, I love children and was in education until retirement.....I do want to suggest that  if there are families visiting there should be a way to accommodate them separately from the school groups. And I felt very sorry for the the cashier, working alone with that very long line of middle schoolers.\"\n\n\"I hate to send you this but I’ve never seen a dining area so filthy and unprofessionally maintained. All of the tables had food, rappers or both on them along with the floors. The cleanest table we found was next to this broom also next to another mess covering the chairs and floor. Also right next to the fountain machines was a cleaning bucket with water and soap splashed everywhere.. I honestly don’t understand how such a high ranked museum can look like this. The thing that bothered me the most was seeing your staff lounging around while the dining area wasn’t busy at all. This pretty much ruined my experience as I’ve longed to come here for years and I’m honestly upset for making a donation to this facility. If I had known it looked like this no money would have been spent.\"\n\n\"You guys should consider doing a light show for Tool. In particular the albums Lateralus, or their newest release, Fear Inoculum. Tool has a pretty decent following and I bet you’d get great turnout.\"\n\n\"Dear Sirs\nWe are family of 6 (4 kids age 3 – 11 ), visiting Boston, my kids really would like to come to the children museum but we can’t afford the admission, our younger is a disabled kid and we are burdened with a lot of medical expenses including overseas treatment (see receipt attached) , we have a card of free access to national parks, I wonder if you are able to give us 6 complimentary tickets or $ 1 for ticket, we are coming from NJ and won’t be able to make it on Friday. \nYour generosity would be appreciated. \"\n\n\n\"Three comments from the same group:\n1. Robert was very kind to our grandchildren while proving cooked food.\n\n2. Robert was cooking at the grill and went out of his way to give my granddaughters their meal on the membership appreciation day.\n\n3. Robert went above + beyond serving my family with a kind smile + great attitude! We truly appreciated the delicious dino nuggets. Robert made my girls' night at member appreciation!\"\n\n\"Two comments from the same group:\n1. The person that attend the Grill was disrespectful with my family members which was very polite with our request. We are on vacation and it was a really bad experience.\n\n2. The person that attend the Grill is being really disrespectful with all the clients.\"\n\n\"Loved the Body Worlds Exhibit\ncould you tell me the name/composer of the music in the Fetus Room - Loved It - very soothing!\"\n\n\"I have been coming to the Lightning Show for almost 40 years Terry was the most engaging, theatrical, and informative presenter I have seen. Well done!\"\n\n\"Destination Mars: New Frontier felt cliche and needs more specific info. Part with woman narrator was unnecessary and a filler. Liked food/music.\"\n\n",

Help make your home a safe digital haven by protecting networks, devices, and online lives with these tips:\n•\tKeep a Clean Machine: having the latest security software, web browser, and operating system is the best defense against viruses, malware, and other online threats. Remember, mobile phones and tablets need updating too! Browsing on your mobile device? Make sure it’s not running suspicious apps or using permissions you didn’t realize you approved.\n•\tLock Down Your Login: usernames and passwords are not enough to protect key accounts like email, bank, and social media. Improve account security by enabling strong authentication tools such as biometrics or unique one-time codes.\n•\tShare with Care: Your personal information is like money, be smart about where you’re sharing it, who you’re sharing it with, and how it’s being used. Cybercriminals love it when you overshare on social media—they can learn all about you! Make it harder by avoiding posting real names, places you frequent, and home, school, and work locations! Watch this video for more tips on reevaluating your digital privacy: https://habitu8.wistia.com/medias/axab9pmatu \n•\tBack It Up: Protect your valuable work, music, photos, and other digital information by making an electronic copy and storing it safely.\n•\tBe Smart about Smart Devices: The Internet of Things – all of those appliances and devices that connect to the Internet and each other on your home network-- is growing exponentially on a daily basis, this is both a good and bad thing. Good in terms of convenience and accessibility, but at the same time those “benefits” can come with some seriously costly drawbacks and vulnerabilities by creating a multitude of opportunities for cybercriminals.

After the discussion, our research & evaluation team will ask for feedback about how we can make the materials better.\n \nThere are two opportunities to join us:\nWednesday (tomorrow), Oct. 16th from 9:00am – 9:45am in Hornblower OR Thursday, Oct. 17th from 12:00pm – 12:45pm in Hornblower\nFeel free to bring your coffee/breakfast/lunch!\n \nThank you, and please let us know if you have any questions.

Once a space is closed, it will remain closed until All Aboard opens to the public:\n\n-Already closed: The Investigate \"living room\", as it's been being used for prototyping over the last few weeks\n-Oct. 28: The \"garage\" area of Investigate will close for prep work\n-Nov. 4: The \"kitchen\" area of Investigate will close for prep work\n-Nov. 12: The gallery space behind the Lighthouse will close for prep work (the Lighthouse will stay on display and accessible to visitors)\n-Nov. 18 - Nov. 22: All Aboard exhibition install\n-Nov. 23: All Aboard public opening\n\nFor details in layout form, please see the image attached to this message.\n\nAll Aboard's last day open to the public will be Tuesday, Jan. 7. Starting Jan. 8, Investigate and the Lighthouse gallery space will be temporary closed once more for a couple weeks as we remove All Aboard and re-install exhibit components.\n\nIf you have any questions (or have a good train pun to share), please reach out to me (gfo@mos.org, x4456) or Julia Tate (jtate@mos.org, x0287).\n\n",

		"messageBody": "National Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2019 is about taking proactive steps to enhance cybersecurity at home and in the workplace. The lines between our work and daily lives are becoming increasingly blurred, and it is more important than ever to be certain that smart cybersecurity practices carry over between the two. When you are on the job your organization’s online security is a shared responsibility. It’s not just the job of IT staff to ensure online safety at work. Creating a culture of cybersecurity includes ALL employees knowing how to protect themselves and the organization and understanding the cyber risks as the business grows or adds new technologies or functions. Everyone must do their part to keep themselves and the Museum safe! \n\nThis month we covered topics on protecting your digital identity at home and in the workplace: \n•\tOWN IT - Understand your digital profile. Understand the devices and applications you use every day to help keep you and your information safe and secure. Stay safe while traveling, shopping, and using social media or smart devices.\n•\tSECURE IT - Secure your digital profile. Protect against cyber threats by learning about security features available on the equipment and software you use. Make sure to set up strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and be vigilant against phishing attempts.\n•\tPROTECT IT - Maintain your digital profile. Be familiar with and routinely check privacy settings to help protect your privacy and limit cybercrimes. Think before you act online (at home or in the workplace) and protect your personal information.\n\nFor more information about connecting with confidence visit: https://niccs.us-cert.gov/national-cybersecurity-awareness-month-2019.\n\nStay cyber safe & have a Happy Halloween,\nRae\n\n",

If inhaled, asbestos fibers may cause serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The US EPA recommends that ACM be managed in place through periodic inspections and prompt repair when damage is noted.&nbsp; It must be removed during building demolition/renovation or if significantly damaged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>MOS Asbestos Program</u></strong></p>\n<p>To minimize exposure of building occupants to asbestos fibers, the Museum of Science has conducted asbestos surveys and implemented an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) program.&nbsp; This program identifies areas with known or presumed ACM, outlines procedures to maintain ACM and identifies what to do in the event of damage to ACMs.&nbsp; The <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Asbestos%20Operations%20and%20Maintenance%20Program.pdf\">O&amp;M program</a>, which includes locations of known ACMs in Section II, can be found on the <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Environmental%20Health%20and%20Safety.aspx\">Hub Safety page</a>.&nbsp; An <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BFFE889D3-9B62-417B-9464-57829F3FD459%7D&amp;file=Asbestos%20Awareness.ppt&amp;action=default\">asbestos awareness</a> and other related training programs are also available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>What You Need to Know</u></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prior to conducting renovations</strong> <strong>or work that may impact building materials such as insulation, ceiling tiles, flooring, etc.,</strong> please contact the MOS asbestos coordinator, Christina Dillard <a href=\"mailto:cdillard@mos.org\">cdillard@mos.org</a> 4249, to determine the presence or absence of ACMs.&nbsp; Avoid impacting or damaging any known or presumed ACMs.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with the asbestos coordinator to provide contractors with <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Asbestos%20Contractor%20Notification.pdf\">asbestos contractor notification forms</a> and returned a signed copy to the asbestos coordinator.&nbsp; Make sure contractors have also received a copy of the <a href=\"https://bmos.sharepoint.com/EHSDocs/Contractor%20Environmental%20Health%20%20Safety%20Program.pdf\">Contractor Health and Safety Program</a> and return the signed acknowledgement to Christina Dillard.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Report damaged ACMs immediately by notifying the asbestos coordinator directly or via x0200.</strong> Do not walk through or otherwise disturb damaged ACM or ACM debris.&nbsp; If possible, remove any potential sources of air disturbance and isolate the area with signage and barriers.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Please contact the asbestos coordinator with questions you may have regarding the ACM management program or to obtain further information regarding specific locations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><u>Training Sessions</u></strong></p>\n<p>On Wednesday <strong>Nov. 6,&nbsp;11:00am - 12:00pm</strong>&nbsp; and &nbsp;Thursday <strong>Nov. 21,&nbsp; 11:00am - 12:00pm</strong>, training sessions will be held in Hornblower for Museum employees directly affected by the O&amp;M program.

		"messageSubject": "October 2019 Comment Cards",
		"messageBody": "October 2019 Comment Cards\n\n\"I was very disappointed with my visit. Half of the second floor in the blue wing was closed and on top of that, a handful of the interactive activities did not work. I paid nearly 30 dollars for half the experience that was advertised.\"\n\n\"Could not get the ticket on the web site\"\n\n\"It would be have been nice to know there is a parking garage  attached to your facility.    \nNothing I saw was available via info on your website ?\"\n\n\"My family visited MOS on October 9 and we had a superb experience when we bought our tickets from Camden.  He engaged my oldest son with talk of Star Wars.  He and both my sons shared their favorite characters and movies.  My sons were so happy to find another Star Wars fan upon arrival!  Camden was very friendly!\"\n\n\"I'd like to be able to go to your website, click on one of the Omni movies and have it tell me my options of day and time for the next month or two.  That should not be difficult for someone setting up the website to do.  Not everyone who is interested in seeing one of the Omni movies has one particular date in mind that they are planning to go to the MOS.  It often depends on what days and times the movie is being shown.  Based on that information, I would then look at my calendar and figure out a good date to go.  Please make your website more user friendly!\"\n\n\"My 8-digit wristband number does not allow me to review the data I shared with you. Why is that? Each time I enter it, the next screen shows the data as eight zeroes. I definitely did participate in at least one station (and reviewed my data afterwards while I was visiting the museum).\"\n\n\"I am still very angry about how I was treated yesterday by your staff. My wife and I are members of the Science Museum and we live in Belmont. We were taking our 7-year-old granddaughter to the Museum, but when we arrived to park in your garage, as we usually do,  your staff member told us the parking garage was full and offered no assistance. We asked where we could park, and they told us the closest parking was at CambridgeSide Galleria, and gestured generally in that direction. BUT, the only turn that I could make was a \"\"right turn only.' I let my wife and granddaughter exit the car and they went into the Museum.  I headed off to park the car, but upon turning right onto Monsignor Obrien Highway , I discovered no obvious way of getting to CambridgeSide Galleria. Also, there were no places to pull over, so I could not tap in a search for the car's GPS. I didn't want to go to the I-93 tunnel to the Airport, so I went left, hoping it would loop back, but I ended up being forced onto the Tobin Bridge and into Revere. Finally I found a place to pull over long enough to use the GPS and 35 minutes later (and after many traffic lights and confusing turns) I got to CambridgeSide Galleria. \nAll of this could have been avoided IF your staff had maps to give people OR if you hired a traffic police office to allow your Members to take a left to go back towards Cambridgeside OR if you used valet parking when there is high demand.\nMerely telling people to park elsewhere is not a good answer.\nI am still angry with the Museum about the situation.\"\n\n\"Dear Boston Museum of Science,\nI love all your exhibits, especially the one about space! My school came on Friday the 4th of October and I noticed that in a section of the space exhibit about firsts in space, you did not put the first woman in space. I’m in girl scouts and my troop studied the first female in space Valentina Tereshkova for an event called \"\"World Thinking Day.\"\" Valentina was from a small town in Russia and she married the first person in space. I think that it is important to show women’s accomplishments as well as men’s. It would be deeply appreciated if you included the first woman in space in the space exhibit and include women in more parts of the museum. I hope that all of your exhibits keep getting better and better.\"\n\n\"Miriam - she was amazing! She sat with us and explained in detail the best places to visit in the museum.\"\n\n\"I purchased a Family membership again this year and was hoping to exchange my IMAX passes for the planetarium (Laser show) passes. As we don't see any value in the IMAX passes, I called trying to exchange them for laser show passes and were told that it is against your policy. From our perspective, we don't see the difference in value as passes for both facilities are essentially just renting chairs and don't cost the MOS any more money.  If this policy can not be changed this time around, can you change it for the next time around? Being given the flexibility to choose or exchange passes will weigh heavily on our decision to renew our membership next year.  Thank you\"\n\n“I find the use of ‘my pronouns’ by the 2 pm demonstrator of the Electricity show on Oct 13 very offensive and triggering. By saying ‘my pronouns’...I feel that this is no longer a safe space. Please refrain.”\n\n“Truly an amazing museum. I could spend days there. In the gift shop, the Starry Sky Galaxy should be removed. It’s a disappointment. Does not work that well.”\n\n“I am very frustrated trying to purchase tickets.  I have tried twice now, and it kicks me out before I have a chance to find all the programs I want to attend.   It is not a straight forward process and the time allotted before your purchases are wiped out is not enough time to make decisions regarding times and shows.  If you could increase the time to more than 5 minutes, it surely would help those of us trying to purchase our tickets ahead of time!!”\n\n“My 8-digit wristband number does not allow me to review the data I shared with you. Why is that? Each time I enter it, the next screen shows the data as eight zeroes. I definitely did participate in at least one station (and reviewed my data afterwards while I was visiting the museum).”\n\nA grandmother stopped by the info desk with a comment about the Body Worlds exhibit. She had taken her grandchildren to see it. We asked her if the kids liked the exhibit. They preferred to go back to the main museum because there was a lack of interactive components and was therefore not that interesting\n\n“Learn how to spell ‘Pittsburgh’ if you want to be wicked smahrt”\n\n“Very shocked that you are not giving teacher's free pass or discount w/ appropriate ID. For a museum of science it's outrageous! Not a member and will certainly not become one!”\n\n\"I have applied for several volunteer positions (posted as being open) since August and have gotten nowhere.\nThis is very disappointing.\nIt is no way to treat potential volunteers, especially ones who might be considering making sizeable donations or bequests.\"\n\n\"In the math section of your museum, I was looking at the wall about famous mathematicians, but didn't see Alan Turing. He in for many people one of the great mathematicians of the XXth century\nDid I miss him, is this an omission, or is this intentional?\"\n\n\"Hi  I am looking to buy a wall chart about 3' x 3' For The Athol Bird & Nature Club, Geology Division.   The chart is Geological Time Table    with colors like the geological maps.      Do you have any and what is there price ?\"\n\n\"I think this place is very cool I love it.\"\n\nTeacher called and told the representative that she thought it was ridiculous that schools have to pay for Body Worlds audio tours. They are paying over $1000 for a field trip, and she thinks the audio tours should be free.\n\n\"The AAH (Astronomy After Hours) program is very interesting with many knowledge. Please run in winter!\"\n\n“What is your reason for focusing STEM month on girls and ignoring boys?  Boys underperform girls at almost every level of schooling.”\n\n“I like everything but the food is too expensive and the store”\n\n“Hi, I tried to renew our membership online last night and it would not go through, no matter what we did! so I called and spoke with a person and she renewed our membership. she entered my email address just so I could receive the confirmation and the receipt. I didn't receive anything. When I tried to update my account information online, tonight the email address for our membership/account is a kiosk ....email address! and I still could not update my email address no matter how many times I went through editing the address. This is very surprising to see MOS website could not operate a simple task of updating an account! Please advice!”\n\n“Terrible! Day old bread with my grilled cheese that was sitting out so ling it was like a brick when I bit into it, Bathroom by cafe was disgusting! Urine all over the floor. Didn't look like it was cleaned all day. Gross.”\n\n\"I just wanted to email to highlight one of your employees who really helped me out the other day. His name was Jeremy - and I called around 3:30 on Friday 10/18. I called to find out whether MOS had a discount for people in the Big Brother Big Sister Program. I was hoping to go with my little brother that evening. It turns out they do not. Jeremy then took the initiative to try to get me and my little brother free tickets to the museum immediately so I could use them that night. He went on hold multiple times trying to coordinate this and ultimately had the tickets emailed to me. I really appreciated the effort, and we had a great time. It was also super helpful because I could not have afforded to pay for two regular price tickets. Can someone please forward this to Jeremy and also his supervisor just to note that he does excellent work!” \n\n“I like everything but the stuff in the store are too expensive.”\n",

They've been actively stirring up their sand which is giving a cloudy appearance to the water. (aka they're already establishing themselves as the troublemakers) We wanted to let everyone know this is completely normal and will eventually resolve itself. As the axolotls continue to get used to their new surroundings, the lighting will be kept dim to help them feel comfortable as they settle in. They are nocturnal by nature, so keeping darker areas in the tank will hopefully encourage more activity during the day. If you haven't checked out our new amphibious co-workers, I highly recommend swinging through HHL and introducing yourself. And for those of you who are not well versed on proper axolotl etiquette: red wiggler worms are their preferred house warming gift.",

The exhibit will be open from today, November 23, through January 7, 2020. \n\nThe All Aboard! experience is completed with other trains-themed offerings throughout the building including the Thomas & Friends exhibit in the Art & Science gallery, the Thomas 4-D movie, the Rocky Mountain Express OMNI film, and the return of the trains-themed Cliff store. \n\nCome check it out!

		"messageBody": "November 2019 Comment Cards\n \n\"I am a member and the cafeteria has been bugging me for a while and after my experience today I had to say something.\nI have celiac disease and none of your food is labeled for any allergies. The staff don't know either.  So I made a salad of just veggies and no dressing and I still had issues when I got home.  Likely the handling of utensils just isn't working to avoid cross contamination. This isn't the first time this has happened.  We paid 20 bucks for food that made me sick.\nI also will mention how filthy the cafeteria was and how bad it smelled.\nMy son loves the cafe but I had to tell him in the future we can't eat there because I get sick Every time.  With all the food allergies and the Massachusetts food allergy law how are you managing this issue so badly?  I encourage you to review this soon.  It could help a lot of visitors.\"\n\n\"I read a troubling article about pressure on employees to upsell. I hope you value all your visitors and our opinions, and that you find ethical ways to keep the museum a healthy financial institution and encourage us all to recognize on a daily basis the humanity of those we work with, for, and among. \n\n\"LOVED the 'Drake' show at the Charles Hayden Planetarium! I'm class of 2016 and couldn't believe I'd never stopped by the museum before. I came to visit my little brother whose still on campus and it was really a great show. \nAre there any plans to do a Frank Ocean planetarium show? Because I'd legit fly back to Boston to see it haha. \nSome feedback -- I think the selection of songs was great, but there should have been a DJ mix versus where the show highlighted verse and chorus/bridge instead of playing the full 3-5 minute song. The show felt kind of short because we only got through 5 songs since the full versions were played. Would waay rather hear more of a spread!\nAnd the 30 minutes really flew by. Would rather the show be an hour (or at leaaaasssst 45 minutes) and would absolutely pay for an increased ticket!! \nWould've been cool to see the lasers in use. \nOverall though, really cool show and idea! It was so much fun bopping along to the songs while being totally transfixed in the animations. The artists did a great job.\"\n\n\"I loved the Museum and the Body World exhibit. One minor concern was that in the Body World film about Alzheimer's, 'loose' was used twice instead of 'lose'. I realize from the credits that the filmmaker and crew may not have been English as first language speakers and you may not be able to fix the grammar but it is very jarring, especially when at the museum with a learning child.\"\n\n\"Good morning-  my wife and I just attended our 3rd MOS 'Experience' in the planetarium. On Friday we went to the opening night of the Drake Experience with our friends after having gone to Rihanna and Beyonce. While we're huge Drake fans, we left feeling slightly underwhelmed by the whole thing. In fact, one of our friends fell asleep briefly during the performance. I'm not sure if this is the right space to voice this type of feedback but I do have some specific notes that may be helpful. If possible I'd love to talk to someone in this department to exchange some ideas. Thanks!\"\n\n\"Enjoyed the exhibit. You showed consequences of smoking and cancer. Would be interesting to see a body that has had drug abuse.\"\n\n\"I'm a MOS member and often bring my 3.5 year old to the museum. I'm writing because the new Thomas exhibit leaves a lot to be desired. We visited the exhibit in Springfield this summer and were enchanted by the experience which had plenty of room and trains to play with. We have now been disappointed twice at the MOS by the exact same exhibit. Each time we've visited there have not been enough trains, too many children, and absolutely no crowd control by the MOS. We are now not coming to the MOS because the Thomas exhibit is a huge draw for my son, but is very stressful because of the number of children and the lack of space and available activities. It leads to my son being overwhelmed and both of us being quite cranky by the end. It is unreasonable to expect that a bunch of 2-5 year olds are going to be rational, sharing tiny people. This is compounded, in my experience, by lack of parental attention--parents seem to just sit on the benches and let the children go. I'm surprised that the MOS is just letting this exhibit, essentially, run by itself.\nHere's my suggestion: much like the Discovery Center, I think you should have museum employees in the room, a cap on how many people can participate at any time, and more trains! Some guidance for caregivers to help set behavior expectations with the children would be great too.\nThanks for considering this feedback.\"\n\n\"Nice Exhibits\n-Inconsistancy I found:\nThe ivory-billed woodpecker sighting in AK in 2005 was a _false sighting_ - what the people saw was actually a pileated woodpecker\"\n\n\"As a longtime supporter of the museum, I was very upset to hear about the recent 'upsell' practices.  This is NOT how the museum should operate and I'm appalled.”\n\n\"Suit/Cabot lab was awesome! Very interactive for 2 kids and 2 adults. Both employee/engineer women were very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. Thanks for a great experience.\"\n\n\"it would be great to have two evenings per week where only adults have/get permission to the exhibit hall\"\n\n\"I would like to know Y the Steam Engine in the Basment of the Blue wing does not have a deminstration Everything seams to Be there for it to work\"\n\n\"It would be nice to have gates at the staircase inside the discovery center (both top and bottom of stairs). It would keep the young kids safer and parents can be more at ease. It would also prevent young kids from throwing balls and items down the steps.\"\n\n\"Had an amazing time at the Museum of Science - Anime Boston Weekend yesterday. I met some awesome people and your employee Megan (the one dressed as Pikachu) was a lifesaver. She helped me figure out where to go in the museum and how the event was run along with giving me a lot of information. She was very warm, inviting and patient. I've been to the museum several times over the years but not enough that I would remember where everything was by heart. Plus, this is the very first time I went on my own. Every other time was with a tour or a group of some kind, so it meant a lot to have someone greet you like that. I saw a lot of truly wonderful things. I even entered a contest too! (Didn't win, came darn close though lol.) Honestly, it was a lot of fun and I've always loved the museum. Seriously can't wait to go back again sometime!\"\n\n\"I am very disappointed to read in the Boston Globe about how badly the MOS treats its front office staff.  I have had many contacts with the ticket office and found them to be very helpful.  After my membership expires, I will continue to visit the museum but only pay for the exact items I need for that visit.\nYou have no idea how bad this looks.”  \n\n\"Nice place! :)\nEnjoying my visit :)\"\n\n\"It was great to see the energy and recycling exhibits.\nI also like the compostable french fry container at the grill. But I saw no composting bin, nor paper recycling bin.\nThose would be great.\"\n\n\"I just renewed my membership. We should have been told this before we renewed.\"\n\n\"Pink Floyd - Great show..enjoyed it! Bring back Led Zeppelin!\"\n\n\"Wonderful! Body World!! One misspelling - prostate gland (almost end of exh.) 'because of IT'S proximity to the rectum...' WRONG please correct Thx!\"\n\n\"I loved the new body exhibit in the red wing. There was a video streaming about how Alzheimer's affects the brain.  There was an alarming misspelling in the video, however. in a few places, the text had spelled the word 'lose' as 'loose'.\"\n\n\"We were at the museum yesterday and had a wonderful time. The only problem we had was with parking. We had all of our tickets validated and we paid for the at the kiosk ($5) but then we were also charged an additional amount when we checked out. It added a lot of cost to our field trip.\"\n\n“This experience was absolutely amazing. The video is only one of many\nI do not know her name, The guide/teacher was great. I was so enchanted by the butterflies, I couldn't pay attention to what she was saying! You can hear her on the video.\nI can't thank you enough.\"\n\n\"Caught an animal show about camouflage given by Lisa on the afternoon of the 15th. It was a great show, very well put together. Lisa was able to answer a slew of questions as we hung around after the show.  Later in the Hall of Human Life we had an engaging interactive about bones with the volunteer Grant. It was thorough, analytical, and enjoyable.\"\n\n\"I would be interested if you could show 'Extreme Weather' again in the future. I missed it first time out i heard great things about it and it must be great if it's only being shown to schools and the such.......i would love to hear from you ......\"\n\n\"It would be great if the museum would house a permanent copy of \"\"Apollo 11 (2019)\"\" in IMAX format. The documentary consists of restored film from NASA and the National Archives. \n\"We love coming here, but I noticed in the Natural Mysteries Room there are a couple drawers mixed up. The echinodrem and the turtle drawer are swapped on the top big drawer and the items are swapped in the small drawers below.\"\n\n\"Any chance of getting a traveling TITANIC Exhibit to come to the Boston Museum of Science? I know they had one in Portland, Maine in 2016. Please add my email if you do plan to sponsor such an exhibit. Thank You\"\n\n\"I came to see the museum and the employee at the Ticket area was very rude and condescending to me when I Present my retired military identification... Very unprofessional! Is this how your organization responds to the men and women that were willing to lay down their life for the country. Very disrespectful!  This is the birth place of the revolution!  You have got to do better!\"\n\n\"I visited the MOS on Friday, 11/22. There was an issue with my transaction at the box office with my tickets. William came to the rescue and handled the situation professionally, pleasantly and efficiently. We were about to walk out until he came over and fixed the problem!!!\"\n\n\" I sent the email below to the information@mos.org address. I received a response from Kelly later that day that my email was being forwarded to the web team. I just wanted to check in to see if there is any update regarding this issue. It would be a real shame to lose functional access to such a great website. I tried to email the information@mos.org address again, but my email would not go through.\nOriginal Email:\nI wanted to contact you about an activity on your website that I have used for years. The original link is: https://legacy.mos.org/quest/et/. However, when you go to that link, it states that the page has been retired. I can view it on the Wayback Machine, but the interactive simulation feature of the activity no longer works. This activity is one of my favorites of our entire ancient Egypt unit, and students really love it, too. Is there another way to access it with its full functionality?\"\n\n\"Hello, I would like to reflect and submit some suggestions about the show at the planetarium dubbed 'The Drake Experience'. The ticket price was great, but you certainly only got $10 worth of an experience which should not be called 'The Drake Experience'. VITAL tracks from his discography through his illustrious career were left out (Marvin’s Room and Ice Melts being only 2 of the many). The visuals were entertaining to an extent however I felt as though the exhibit needed to adhere to the taste of the viewers in terms of the visual experience. It didn’t really go with the music, and there were many missed opportunities that myself and many others highlighted upon leaving. I also wouldn’t recommend following Find Your Love with Hotline Bling. That’s just a mess. If you have a job opening please forward me the info, you need my playlist. I could bring some much needed zest to the party.\"\n",

Under mentorship from Boston University and MOS mentors, these teens have been developing child development research studies to be run with families visiting the museum.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the studies the teens are developing is related to children’s judgments of others’ sharing behaviors. To be able to run this study, the teens are looking for children between the ages of <strong>5 and 8 years</strong> who would be willing to be actors in a short video, in which they would model playing a game that would be shown to other child participants who come to the museum. Children would be asked to sit in front of a machine that dispenses Skittles into bowls, and pull a specific lever to dispense the candies in a certain way (that is either advantageous or disadvantageous to themselves). \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you have or know of any children who would be interested in being videotaped for this study, please email rfyler@mos.org. The total time needed to film would be about 20 minutes, and we are happy to work with whatever schedule is best for you (including weekends). All child actors would be compensated with a small gift for contributing to this research project!\n</p>\n<p>\nThanks for your consideration,\nRachel\n</p>",

Dining room set, table and 4 chairs, $200 obo\n\n- - - - - - -\nQUEEN SIZE SLEEPER SOFA, RED, $300 obo\n\nThis sofa extends into a queen size bed. Dark burgundy red with big soft back cushions and plush fabric. The seat cushions are pleasantly firm and slightly springy. No stains, bare spots, rips, or runs in the fabric. The mechanism that slides the bed in and out works perfectly. I bought this new for over $800.\n\nThe mattress is like new; I rarely used it, and when I did, I protected it with a mattress pad and memory foam topper. I’m including the queen-size, 3\" thick, memory foam mattress topper with the sofa. It makes the thin mattress much more comfortable.\n- - - - - - -\n\nQUEEN SIZE BED STORAGE BED FRAME, GRAY, $400 obo\nPlatform bed frame with 8 built-in drawers, excellent condition. Mattress not included. This platform bed is upholstered in gray fabric with a suede-like feel. I bought this new for $1500 from.  The generously sized drawers give the bed frame an amazing storage capacity. They are built into 2 fully assembled boxes that hook side by side to form the bed platform. Also includes a headboard. So the bed comes in 3 pieces for relatively easy transport and storage.\n- - - - - - -\nDINING TABLE AND CHAIRS, $200\nDining set made from dark hardwood with 4 cushioned ladder-back chairs.

There are three pages total, though your middle page will depend on your response to a question about whether you have presented at Coffee Talk in the past.\n \nEven and perhaps especially if you have never been to Coffee Talk, your input is welcome! Our hope is to grow and widen the scope of this professional development opportunity to include as many of our staff as possible. Your response is fully anonymous and does not require signing in. The more answers you can give us, the better armed we will be to set up Coffee Talk 2.0 for the new year!\n \nPlease take the survey linked above by Tuesday, December 17th to weigh in on what Coffee Talk looks like in 2020!\n \nThank you so much,\nTeam Coffee Talk\nArga Yunus, Engineering Design Workshop\nEric O'Dea, Live Presentations\nLindsey Kolenda, Discovery Center\nMeghan Carter, School and Youth Programs\nNicole Merullo, Hall of Human Life\nRachel Fyler, Exhibit Innovation Projects\nSarah Weiner, Live Presentations\nSteve Adams, Exhibit Hall Interpretation",

		"messageSubject": "December 2019 Comment Cards",
		"messageBody": "December 2019 Comment Cards\n\n\"The Drake Experience?  Considering that he's under investigation for Child Molestation and a host of related charges, isn't this a bad offering for the Museum?\nPlease reconsider this.\"\n\n\"two emails from a member account:\n1. The Mugar Omni Theatre is the reason I join but I almost can't stand to watch the films because the introduction is so unbearable. It's silly and undignified, unworthy of the majestic films. A silly tittering woman's voice with a silly little laugh and a little cough - the only explanation I can find is that this particular woman donated a million dollars to the museum? and if she has to explain who Leonard Nimoy is, maybe it's time to retire him!\nHonestly, it's so annoying it's unbearable especially when going to two in a row which my friend and I like to do. Please please please, if you are renovating the theatre, please renovate the intro as well!\nIf you don't believe me, try sitting through it ten times in a row, you will be out of your mind . . .\n\n2. Please, since you are updating the Omni theater, could you please also update the introduction?  Most of the sounds are nice, but the final crash is really disturbing, and for this sound to then be followed by 'now sit back, relax,...' is not at all relaxing.\"\n\n\"Please, would you mind having a stool or boost in the bathrooms so kids can reach the water when they're washing their hands? Thank you!\"\n\n\"Please keep Leonard Nimoy's voice in the renovated theater!!!\"\n\n\"The purpose of this email is to inform your organization of the concerning experience I had. I attempted to take two friends to see the Polar Express 4D experience.  I purchased tickets online, with no issue, receiving mobile tickets.  The ticket stated: Bring this confirmation directly to the entrance; displayed on your mobile device or printed at home.\nThe three of us, one a child, took a bus and three trains to get to the museum.  Upon arrival we were told that we needed to purchase an additional $90 worth of tickets to gain entry to the museum, just to see the show.  The time was 7pm, and with the museum closing soon, it seemed like nothing short of a scam.\nNot only did this experience waste 3 hours of my time in transit, the customer service experience was quite poor.  When I asked the box office attendant why I was able to purchase tickets online without notification of needing to spend additional money to gain entry, the reply was, 'I don't know, I didn't design the website.'\nThe box office attendant refunded my money for the 4D experience, and commented that this ticketing issue 'happens all the time'.  It is incredibly concerning that MoS- a museum of science and technology- would have such a poorly designed web store algorithm, to the point that customers are not made aware of the additional ticketing requirements until arriving to the facility.\nI grew up going to the MoS.  I credit my childhood experiences at the MoS with guiding me into a career in science.  It is appalling that an organization I am so fond of would knowingly treat it's customers in a dishonest manner, in an attempt to make money.\"\n\n“I had opportunity to see the Body World exhibit yesterday. What I found very disturbing (and I realize the exhibit was not created by MOS) was the initial part that showed faces aging over time. All of the faces portrayed were those of white/light-skinned people. As an older white man, I find this extremely troubling and cannot imagine what it would be like for children, youth, and adults of color to be confronted with this. I wish this had been different as it had a negative impact on me as I started the exhibit which had many impressive aspects. I would hope that MOS program staff would attend to who gets included/portrayed (and how) and who is excluded in any exhibits there.”\n\n “Hi, Please please please consider bringing back the Fleetwood Mac Experience show to the Planetarium please please I wasn't able to see it when it was out please bring it back I would appreciate it so much. Even if it's for one or two weeks. Please bring it back soon.\nThank you”\n\n“PLEASE DO AN OASIS PLANETARIUM MUSIC SHOW!!!!!!!!”\n\n“Hello,\nI visited Body Worlds & The Cycle of Life.\nI was learning so much there that I almost missed my train home. \nI am a former physics instructor, and I'd like to mention two things that concern me about the exhibit.\nThey both involve the concepts of force and pressure.\nFirst, the section of the exhibit section that shows how to properly lift with one's legs seems to say that pressure is measured in pounds. That is not correct. Pressure can be measured in pounds per square inch, newtons per square meter, and other ways. But pressure is not measured in pounds; force is measured in pounds.\nSecond, the section on blood pressure seems to say that blood pressure is a force. That is not correct.\nPressure is force per unit area, but it is not just force.\nAs you probably know, many Americans think that they can have their own truth.\nWhen considering the difference between force and pressure (at least), they are wrong.\nI realize that you probably cannot change the exhibit before it ends in January.\nI hope, however, that you will find this information helpful and that you will pass it on to anyone who will host Body Worlds in the future.\nThank you”\n\n“Not obvious how to apply my free membership Omni passes.  Got to checkout and did not see.”\n\n“I am hereby notifying you that when our membership comes around again for renewal we do not wish to renew.\nI am completely horrified at the Body World Exhibit.  There are no words.  It strikes me as disrespectful and ghoulish.  Don't tell me 'it's educational'.  It is being presented as 'entertainment' and a revenue generator.  I, for one, am not entertained.  So my money next year will be spent on a membership to the Museum of Fine Arts.\nThank you.”\n\n “Hello,\nI just wanted to write a note and say that we are not renewing our membership this year because we have tried to go at least 15 times during the last 2 years, during which w were premier members, and the garage was full EVERY time. We couldn't park anywhere else close enough to walk over in inclement weather, so the membership was really a waste of money. Not to mention the wasted drive there each time. \nThere should be parking spots reserved for members and a spot should be available for purchase online. \nWe'll miss you.”\n\n“I recently purchased a membership for my boyfriend who started going to the museum while waiting for me at work in Boston. We live in Rhode Island. He was obsessed with going to Body Worlds and I know there is so much more to see!\nWe did attend Body Worlds. While on a break getting coffee at \"\"Starbucks\"\" cafe I bought a pack of little crackers labeled $1.60 approx. I was billed $3.something on my debit card!\nI complained on Twitter - Dec. 2nd- but, absolutely no reply there. (If you have a Twitter acct., I feel you really should monitor it.) I copied the Attorney General.\nSo, I had to slog out this email instead. \nPlease do not allow this to happen to others. PLEASE MAKE MORE CLEAR that you vending machine is there for the purpose of ripping people OFF. What about a pack of .25 cent crackers makes them $3.00 there?? It's not Martha's Vineyard. \nPlease find a way to answer me and return my money.”\n\n\"I would like to see a new membership level that includes everything with premier 8, but with more tickets included for Butterfly garden/4D theater and/or temp exhibit tickets.\"\n\n\"I was visiting the museum on 12/17/19 and at the Thomas train exhibit at around 11am. An employee (or volunteer?) named Steve spent over an hour with my 3 year old daughter! The patience, kindness, and attention he showed was incredible as he played and read to her. As a museum member, that was our best experience so far and it all because of the time Steve spent interacting with my child!\"\n\n\"The GIFT Shop is a 'huge' disappointment! It looks like a toy store. Really will a baby know where the pink or blue stuffed whatever came from the MOS> Where are all the informative Books & Materials for those over 12 years old?\nNo Reply needed just action please\"\n\n\"I'm writing with a comment about the Discovery Center. We often feel like there's a problem with the algorithm that governs how many people enter. We applaud the idea of limiting access over time so it doesn't get too crowded. The day we were there however, we were told it was too crowded but that we could go in after about 15 minutes; once we got in, we found there were no more than 25 people in the area, on both floors combined, and we could see through the door that families were still being turned away. We told one of the volunteers, who went outside to tell the person monitoring the area to let more people in, but it feels like there's a flaw in the system. There's so much space in there; families shouldn't be turned away until there are at least 50-75 people in there. That's especially the case because being families who are turned away are usually going to go into the main exhibit area, and it's not an easy process for families with small children to hoof it to the main exhibit area and find something to do and then turn around and hoof it back to the Discovery Center -- and that's if they receive the notification text, which itself sometimes doesn't work, as we've found (by asking if it was our turn after our estimated wait time had elapsed, only to find out that we'd been sent a text that we never received).\"\n\n\n“Last I was there was during the BiCentennial I am a fan of Star Wars , just today I'd seen an article showing a Naboo Starfighter on display, but it was from 2005, my loss would there be any way of knowing what happened to that exhibit?”\n\n\"I loved the microscopic water bears and looking at the microscope. I LOVED the colored pencil close-up. SO COOL & FUN! (Hands on Lab)\"\t\n\n\"Hi I think the museum is awesome! the new body worlds is SUPER COOL! :)\t\n\n\"Your Membership web site needs some serious work:\n1) The account can only be linked to a single member on the membership, despite have 2 members on the card.  \n2) Resetting the password only prompts ONCE for a new password, and doesn't ask you to verify or retype it in any way.  And it's obscured, with no way to see cleartext.  How am I to know if I typed the new password in correctly?  \n3) There are multiple email addresses associated with the account.  I can set preferences for them, but I can't delete any of them?  Why can't I manage my email addresses?\n4) While I can edit the info for [my individual record], I can't edit or change any associated person on the membership.  Why not?\nHaving a background in web development, I know this is basic stuff that I would expect handled in this day and age.  And as an institute promoting STEM, I would think you'd want a less frustrating experience for your members.\"\n\n\"please put agates on display like Molly of Denali\"\n\n“Goodmorning,\n This email is regarding the disappointment we had in your David Bowie Laser show. I thought it may have been just me and I hadn't seen a show in a couple of years but after people were walking out, it made it clear that it wasn't what most thought was going to be lasers, lights, LIVE laser made images. The other unfortunate part was this was the person I brought, First time. He'd like to go to the museum, can you honor our tickets to allow him a good experience? “\n\n\n“Can you purchase tickets for the laser shows at the door or at the museum it self? Before the show starts can you buy tickets?”\n\n\"As a member of the MOS for 8 years, I am utterly dissapointed and disgusted with the process/procedure for the wait list to enter the Discovery Center. Staff member says they wait 15 mins for a family to arrive, and then would text the next family. At #20 on the list, how long would that take us to enter? 5 hrs? 3 hrs? There are many better solutions!\nP.S. The wait has never seemed this impossible before!”\n\n\"In the bird section there is a wrong ID. It says red-winger warbler when the birds are red-winged blackbirds. also the last nuimber of each column is cut off o the ID sheets.\"\n\n\"A visitor stopped me (staff in red coat) to say they're big train enthusiasts and they really liked this year's All Aboard. Much better than last year's. Family (of 4) came to MOS for this.\"\n\n\"I would like to share my experience with the vending machine I chanced to use towards the evening. The vending machine 'accepts' dimes and quarters but doesn't give any credit towards them. Cancelling the transaction doesn't return the money either since the machine wanted me to make a purchase first. I had to insert more paper currency to pay for my snacks. On completion of the transaction the machine returns the balance in coins excluding the amount that I had put through the coin slot earlier.\nI've been deprived of some cash by the machine and intend to get it back. I would like your help in this matter by providing the manufacturer's contact number and make of the machine as well as the business that has installed it there. These can usually be found near the payment terminal on the machine or the glass in front of the snacks. It's the snacks vending machine between the two beverage machines right next to the riverside café in the red wing. I'm informed that complaints of this nature are taken seriously in the industry. I earnestly request your assistance in this matter.\"\n\n\"1. DoD has started a Digital Engineering Strategy (DES) that uses models to prototype systems before construction. This might be something to try in your engineering workshop.\n2. You might want to contact STEM From Dance, a NYC program that uses dance to intriduce girls to STEM This would make for an interesting presentation\n3. The Mathematica history did not include lt. Wronski. He is a minor mathematician but he did develop the Wronskian, that is used for differential equations\n4. The brain teasers of the Winter 2020 Bent of Tau Beta Pi has a problem to develop a formula to calculate the sun's angle at noon for all the days of the year. This might be an interesting addition to the Mathematica exhibit\"\n",

		"messageBody": "Please remember if you need to request to have your department use the Blue Wing exhibit hall from July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021 in the evenings ONLY. Please remit your requests to nyang@mos.org by Wednesday, January 8th. \n\nTO: Museum Management Team and Museum Event Planners\nFROM: Sheryl White Vincent, Director, Event and Conference Services\nRe: July 2020 – June 2021 Space Sharing\nDate: Thursday, November 21, 2019\nPlease forward this to staff in your department that plan(s) events using the Blue Wing exhibit halls.\nWhy so far ahead?\n\nRevenue generating departments such as Event & Conference Services, the catering division of our in-house food service vendor Wolfgang Puck, and Overnights must make revenue projections for the next fiscal year budget based on what they have to sell, namely the Blue Wing. Other departments such as Advancement and Lectures & Special Programs also need to budget and plan for the upcoming year. Departments that do not plan and schedule as far out can find themselves with out a Blue Wing date for their upcoming event. While everyone tries to be flexible, it becomes difficult once commitments are made to budgets and contracts. This group is aware that dates do change for exhibit openings and thus space sharing negotiations do happen through out the year to accommodate event schedules.\n\nNext Steps\nEach department that requires the use of the Blue Wing (including Cahners Theater or CS&T) during non-public hours between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 must identify their needs NOW.\nWe are striving to identify the MUST have needs now, meaning if you “think” you might need a date, but you are really not sure, please don’t ask for it. The calendar will be open for those additional requests moving forward, so holding a date for just in case is not necessary.\n\nIf you cannot target an exact date, please communicate the day of the week and the month of your activity or event. Activities such as exhibit installations, construction and large set-ups must be scheduled as well.\nThis information is due to Nora Yang (mailto:nyang@mos.org) by 5pm on January 8th. Thereafter, the Space Sharing Task Force will meet to review requests for the Blue Wing. It is the intention of this group to allocate Blue Wing dates by January 31st",

During this time we will be performing a code upgrade with an outside vendor to address an issue we are having with our network connectivity.  \n\nWhat Does This Mean?\nInformation Technology will be taking down the network tonight at 8:30pm for a minimum 4 hour window.  During our outage window, we are working with an outside vendor to address any issues should they arise and access to server, system, and network resources will be limited and intermittent (This includes Zeus and Tessitura).  VPN into the building will also be impacted while our firewalls are updated one at a time.\n \nWhat Can I Expect When This Takes Effect?\nDo not panic!  Email (hosted in the cloud with Microsoft) will still be available during this maintenance window to external users.  Our main website, www.mos.org, will also be up (with appropriate messaging for visitors).    \n\nWhat Do I Need To Do?\nInformation Technology would like all users to close out of all system applications and files before leaving for the night.   At the close of our maintenance window we will send an update to staff. As always, if you have any questions or issues, please contact our service desk, System Support Services, at ithelp@mos.org or call x0130.  You can also submit a request online.\n\nRegards,\n\nAngela\n\n",

We asked him about his background, how he sees the role of science centers overall, what he’s looking forward to most about being at the Museum of Science, and of course what his favorite sports team is. I invite you to have a look at these as a way to get to know Tim and to learn about what drives him in leading our institution. You can find all the videos <a href='https://www.mos.org/tim-ritchie-interview' target='_blank'>here on our website</a>.\n\nI also wanted to remind you of our all staff welcoming for Tim from 3:00pm – 5:00pm on Tuesday February 4th.  In order to ensure we all have an opportunity to attend this important event, the Museum will close at 2:45pm that day. The event will start with an all-staff meeting in Cahners Theater at 3:00pm followed by a reception in the Blue Wing.\n\nI invite you all to join me in welcoming Tim to the Museum of Science!\n\n<i>Wayne Bouchard</i>",

		"messageSubject": "MOS Service Animal Policy",
		"messageBody": "With Dogs: A Science Tail opening on Sunday, this is a good time to remind everyone of the Museum’s Service Animal Policy. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\nOnly service animals, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)(42 USC §12101 et. seq.), are allowed in the Museum building. This means no pets, emotional support animals or therapy animals are allowed. Any individual can request a reasonable accommodation to any museum policy. \n \nUnder the ADA, places of public accommodation are only permitted to ask the following questions of an individual seeking admission with a service animal:\n1) “Is this a service animal required because of a disability?”\n2) “What work or task has this animal been trained to perform?”\n \nThe Museum has determined that these questions can only be asked by public safety staff in public areas of the building, and by visitors services staff at gated entry points (EH gates, Omni, Planetarium, Discovery Center). Once a visitor has entered a paid area of the museum, a person with a service animal should not be asked about it. This is to avoid well-meaning staff and volunteers from approaching the same visitor multiple times during their visit. If a volunteer, staff person or visitor sees a service animal behaving inappropriately anywhere in the museum, they should contact public safety immediately.\n \nDefinitions/additional information\n \nThe ADA defines service animals as dogs or miniature horses, individually trained to provide assistance to a person with a disability. The service that the animal provides must be directly related to the person’s disability.\n \nThere are requirements that a service animal handler must follow:\n1) The animal must be leashed, tethered or harnessed, unless these devices interfere with the animal’s work, or the individual’s disability prevents them from using these devices.\n2) The animal must be under the handler’s control at all times.\n3) The animal must be housebroken.\nIf a service animal is out of control or disruptive, the handler can be asked to remove the animal, but must be offered the opportunity to return without the animal. \n \nMGL Ch. 129 §39F extends all of the rights that the ADA confers on service animal handlers to individuals TRAINING service animals in Massachusetts. This means that people coming in to train service dogs cannot be refused. The dogs can be very young, but are still expected to be under control and housebroken.",

I was wrong, as the cheapest item was $1.55.\nMy first complaint is that items being priced at $1.55 is ridiculous.  Not only is that way too expensive for the items on offer, it also brings in the need for small coin change where there should not be.  Just price it at $1.50 if you feel the need to price gouge, don't add the extra nickel just because you can.\nMy second complaint is what happened after I realized my dollar wouldn't be enough.  I hit the cancel button on the machine, expecting to get my dollar back, or at least coins worth the same amount.  But instead, I was greeted with the lovely message \"\"No change given unless purchase made\"\".  I tried a number of different buttons trying to cancel it and get my money back, but nothing worked.  Essentially, this vending machine held my money ransom to try and force me into a purchase I literally could not afford to make.  I don't care about losing one dollar, it won't make me go hungry.  But this needs to be changed.\"\n\n\"There is an exhibit piece on the lower level that is a disc of fluid, you are encouraged to spin it to observe eddies and fluid dynamics. It is beautiful. I would like to know what the fluid is inside it.\"\n\n\"Megan & Sarah were two presenters today (top science/space stories of 2019, Electricity Theater). They did an excellent job and are always a pleasure to watch. I've seen them several times & always look fwd to it.\"\n\n\"Sarah who presented top 10 space stories and Meghan who presented top 10 science stories were both fantastic. My whole family has enjoyed their science talks each time we've come in the past few years. They speak clearly and specifically, obviously well versed in their areas, on top pf good stage presence.\"\n\n\"The lockers are unnecessarily expensive :(\"\n\n\"I received a phone call from a guest today who wished me to relay their concerns about their visit to the appropriate parties.  They first wanted to note that our staff had been very kind and welcoming for most of their visit.  However, their experience with the Discovery Center line did not match the rest of their day.  They said that they approached the Discovery Center agent around 3:30pm.  That staff member was chatting with a friend when they approached.  They asked if the Discovery Center was indeed full.  They felt the response of 'It’s at capacity according to the sign' was delivered in a curt manner and were dismayed when the agent returned directly to their conversation with the friend.\"\n\n\"There were no times on the door of the educator library so now I have to come back because I was lacking that info you needed to provide. Closing at 3:30 is hard for teachers availability.\"\n\n\"I visited the museum yesterday with my 2 year old daughter and Anna in the Discovery Center was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC with the kids. She engaged my toddler in learning about bones. I am so excited we decided to join the museum as a family this year! Just had to relay our awesome experience :)\"\n\n\"I spent $140 on a membership & $25+ on a show and you also try to squeeze money from me for a coat check?!! Really !?? I am extremely unlikely to renew my membership.\"\n\n\"My family and I visited the museum. We had tickets to see the body world exhibit and then tickets to visit the science museum after. However, soon after entering the body world exhibit (approximately 5 - 10 minutes), my son fainted and we had to leave the exhibit and the nice staff there called the medic asking for water and an ice pack. Unfortunately, the medic was not much help and did not bring either of those two items requested. The only help that was offered to us was the call to the medic. My niece and I ended up walking through the body world exhibit very quickly while my son and my fiancé stayed outside to rest after the episode. We ended up leaving the museum right after the quick walk through and did not visit the science museum. I was not going to comment on the incident because I am not much of a complainer. However, I was quite disappointed in the medic and the overall lack of help that we were given. I thought that maybe by sharing our visit that this issue could be addressed so that another family that is in the same situation receives much better care and compassion than we received. Thank you for listening.\"\n\n\"Recently I visit with my family the Museum of Science MA. The museum needs a good renovation. Most of the collections are old and if you compare with other museums of science around the world it`s poor. Plus the price of the tickets is too expensive for those old collections. Thank you and a Happy New Year!\"\n\n\"Need Signs going into the Parking area is a nightmare there is no or little signage & people fight to turn in. You need a traffic light too\"\n\n\"We came to see the exhibit, and the parking garage was closed at 12:05 pm. The public safety staff just said \"\"It's closed\"\" 3 times when I asked \"\"why\"\" and \"\"for how long.\"\" It cost me over an hour of my very precious 3 hour visit. So rude!\"\n\n\"Please place signs in museum for easier navigation. The bod exhibit is extremely difficult to find\"\n\n\"Aloha, I was excited to hear a 'plug' for MoS on NPR!  My wife is an International Bachelorette high school math teacher.  Dinner time discussions with our three children bring out many great ideas, which is why I am contacting you today.  My background in architecture coupled with my work as a bicycle instructor led me 6 years ago to become the USA agent for a German bike company solely for children.  Over these years of working with many schools within the USA to bring cycling to the youngest riders, focused on the 2 to 8 year olds,  I discovered how cycling can explain many scientific principles.  These include motion, momentum, energy in to energy out, how we eat, and on and on ever expanding like a DNA molecule.  All the while, the bike, especially the running bike  by KOKUA LIKEaBIKE, is a great tool for this discussion and experimentation.  I don't have a direct 'ask' beyond wanting to start a discussion with a science based learning center such as MoS about how we might work together to bring a FUN, HEALTHY, LEARNING activity for children and parents of young children.  The closest example I have experience with is yearly balance bike rodeo at the Honolulu Museum of Art. I really hope that we could have a conversation.  With sincere aloha.\"\n\n\"Please start serving chicken and waffles in the cafe. Thank you!\"\n\n\"This comment does not pertain to a museum visit, but rather to an email exchange with Jeremy at the MoS.  I had tickets for Saturday evening's planetarium shows when my date became ill at the last minute. I wrote to the Info email address asking whether the tickets could be used at a future date. I received a reply from Jeremy within minutes.  He asked when I would like to attend the shows and reissued the tickets. It was all very fast and professional.  It's not very often that one has such a high-quality experience with customer service in this world.  Kudos to both Jeremy and the MoS!\"\t\n\n\"awesome museum but one of the skulls didnt have a name next to the [illegible] in exhibit w/ the polar bear I think\"\n\n\" A member wanted to let us know that they are canceling one step renewal because of the Globe article. Their comment was that they were dismayed to hear that we aggressively market one-step renewals and other items.\"\n\n\n\"British Steve in the Science Lab is absolutely amazing. filled w/ knowledge and helped our crew of 8 test conductivity, density, etc\nThe BEST!!\"\n\n\"The Hands-On Lab is the highlight of our visit every time we come!\"\n\n\" What do you think about providing an electronic membership card, for apple and android smartphones - Apple wallet, for instance? It would be better for the environment, and also more convenient than carrying a card around. There might even be a cost savings if you did not have to pay for the cards to be made and mailed. \nThanks for considering!\"\n\n\"I visited the museum yesterday with my family and we had a wonderful time! We went to the Lightning show (I believe it was @ 2pm), and I would like to offer a suggestion. At the beginning, there was a 'zap the kids' part. And, unfortunately, one of the kids reacted badly to it and had a hard time recovering. My suggestion is instead to 'zap the parents'. I realize it's probably great to get the kids involved, but I can tell you -- if my kids saw their Dad get zapped on stage, it would be hilarious for them! I think it would also be less variable, doing that with adults instead of kids. Thank you for your consideration!\"\n\n\"At a recent visit, I interacted with your 'Hall of Human Life' exhibit.  This exhibit solicits a significant amount of data from visitors, some of it deeply personal, and I was wondering:\n1.  What is your data retention policy - how long do you maintain the data?\n2.  For what purposes is the data utilized?  Is it part of ongoing research and, if so, which research?  Is there an IRB involved?\nAs you no doubt know, de-identified data can often be easily de-anonymized, and I am thus looking for more information on how you protect your visitors' personal data.\"\n\n\"We came to the museum today and were surprised at how dirty the exhibits for kids to participate in were. The exhibit about the river where the fish tanks are.\nThere are activities for kids to build bridges and one with floating weights. The water had a terrible odor, was yellow with things floating inside. It is obvious the water has not been changed in a long time. If kids or anyone is playing with stagnant water it needs to be changed daily otherwise people are going to get sick.\nI was very disappointed in the poor upkeep and lack of basic sanitation.\"\n\n\"We have visited many times. This time we were very disappointed. There were a few area closed for new attractions coming. As I understand I also feel that for the price and having a few areas closed was quite a turn off. Also the water in the Charles River exhibit was very disgusting. It was very clouded with lots of floaters. The smell from the water was horrible. Also one was yellow. I feel like this is a health hazard in a way. I refused to let my daughter play in it.\"\n\n\" We visited MOS and choose to get our grandchildren to the Planetarium, hoping they will learn more about the stars and planets. Instead, 70% of the show was about learning Chinese and how great the China is. Why I agree that the Chinese culture is rich and old, this was not the right place to advertise it and cultural propaganda! Moreover, it was misleading to promise a show about stars and serve the kids something else. I would like to have cost of the tickets refunded or have issued new tickets   (for 6 of us) for other shows, except Planetarium (at least until the show will be about planets and stars). \"\n\n\"A member called today at 10:20. She wanted to see if any spaces had become available for a couple of courses that she tried to sign up for at 9am. Those courses were full. The member was in tears. She wanted us to share that She felt that it was unfair that spaces could become full when a member so clearly tried to sign up at the start of sign-ups. She also wanted to let us know that she may be calling to get a refund for a course that she was able to book and that she may wish to ask for a refund of her membership.\"\n\n\"I noted that in your mineral exhibit you have a beryl from Royalston, Ma. This is a particulary valuable specimen which should be protected and not accessable easily.\"\n\n\"I just renewed my membership with the idea that I would be able to enjoy my two extra Omni pass tickets. When I look on the web site where it shows what passes I have, it shows that the extra passes were added to my last year's total. Seeing how my last year's membership expires on 3/31/2020 and the fact that the Omni theater is not reopening until Spring 2020 which I assume could be after 3/31 it looks like I will not be able to use the extra passes. I would have assumed that the extra passes would have been put on next year's membership. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Why isn't the coatroom open? It is winter! I expected this service to be available especially after paying for a family membership.\"\n\n\"We are big fans of the museum and have been members for the past few years.  We visited the Bodies section and my almost 5-year-old son was very intrigued by the exhibit of the big sneezing nose - there are 2 yellow balls representing pollen that you put into the nostrils of a giant nose, then you press a button and the nose sneezes them out.  Unfortunately, last night he tried to simulate what he saw by putting a small toy part into his nose and trying to sneeze it out.  The toy part got stuck and we had to go to urgent care for a doctor to take it out.  It was traumatic for him (he had to be put in a straight jacket-like contraption because he was struggling so much) and horrible for me to watch.  I hope the museum will reconsider this exhibit - perhaps put a warning sign to not attempt this on yourself (I never even thought of warning him because he's never shown any interest in putting foreign objects up his orifices) or adjust the exhibit somehow.  It just does not seem like a good idea for an exhibit to suggest kids put things into noses...\"\n\n\"When does the dog exhibit end?  I've had this problem before with your website.  It's great to know when an exhibit opens, but if I can't go then or am going on vacation, etc., I'd like to be able to know when the exhibit ends so that i can make plans.\"\n\n\"I have a 7th grader who is very interested in the Science on Screen summer program that is offered to grades 3-5 this summer (July 3-7th). Is there any chance that Science on Screen can be offered for middle school kids during this week this summer? It would be a fantastic experience for middle schoolers interested in creating stop motion.\"\n\n\"I wanted to reach out after spending an awesome day at the museum with you all. Overall, we had a great experience. The students were really invested in the exhibits, and everyone at the museum was super friendly!\nI did want to reach out regarding one of the demos in the Exciting Energy show. One of the demos shown involved the demonstrator with a bullwhip. She explained the purpose of this as showing a transfer of energy into sound, or a 'sonic boom'. While I think the intent of this was to show a different example of energy transfer, I think the impact of this demo failed to recognize the historical significance and context of a bullwhip. Yes, bullwhips are used to herd cattle, but they were also used as instruments of torture and enslavement for hundreds of years. Several students exited the show discussing connections they had to history class in terms of slavery, and some students were quite disturbed by this. Given the fact that you welcome students of African American descent on a daily basis, I would encourage you to consider a different demo for this show. If bullwhips are the only instrument available that produces this, it seems that it is not really that relevant to be sharing with students anyways. \nI look forward to hearing how you will address this concern.\"\n",

We have unanimously decided to stop the use of that demonstration in any of our education programs onsite or in the community.</p><p>The gift of comment cards and constructive dialogue, as demonstrated by this comment, tells us that even with our best intentions we can always learn from our community on how we can grow our offerings to be consistent with our values and our complete commitment to being a welcoming community space to all.</p><p>Our decision to remove that demonstration active immediately was taken in direct alignment with our values that all are welcome and our programs, facilities, exhibits all need to reflect that value.</p><p>Each of us interacts with school groups, each of us cares about making sure that all are welcome here at the museum so I wanted to share this action taken to ensure that you all know our commitment to that value.

		"messageBody": "In light of all of the exciting transformation and construction happening around the Museum of Science, we will be featuring an internally-developed temporary exhibit that showcases large-scale images from our archives! \nThe exhibit, titled \"Building Our Museum: The Making of Science Park\", will be on display in the \"Blue Wing, Level 2\" gallery (internally called the Art & Science Gallery, and where Thomas & Friends was most recently on display). \nIt will open this Saturday, February 15, and will close Sunday, May 10.\n\nThe images in the exhibit highlight some iconic elements of the Museum, including the installation of the original and current T. rex in the Blue Wing, the original construction of the OMNI and Planetarium, and some incredible aerial shots of Science Park over the past several decades (and shown here is an image of the Blue Wing!)\n\nThis exhibit aims to not only call attention to past construction around the Museum, but also highlight some of the current construction projects and future plans, encouraging visitors to imagine what they might want our our building to look like. In addition to the incredible images from our building's history, we're incorporating a couple low-tech interactive elements: a magnetic-wall interactive where visitors can create their own MOS-layout with various components, and Imagination Playground's Blue Blocks (you may have come across these at other museums and schools). This exhibit came together extremely quickly, and we're excited to be able to learn more about how visitors might use this space and these low-tech interactive elements.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at x4456 or gfo@mos.org\n\n",

To find out more info about the drive: https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/boston/bruins-pj-drive/ \n\nWhy pajamas??  Pajamas have always been one of my favorite items to donate to charity and they are highly sought after by charitable groups.  Having a pair of pajamas gives a feeling of comfort and home even if they are living in a shelter.  Changing into pajamas is a demarcation for when night has arrived and it signals that it is time to sleep.  Pajamas can be fun and allow children to express themselves in ways that their clothes may not.\n\nWhat kind??  Winter, summer, spring, fall.  Any season!  Boys, girls, gender neutral.  Size Newborn - Adult M.  Don't forget the big kids too.\n\nWhere to get them??  This time of year, winter pajamas are on sale!  You can go to Walmart, Target, Kohls, etc (or online like me!) and get Pjs for kids at $5 or less!  \n\nLet's fill up those boxes!!!\n",

But is this due to a lack of scientific evidence, or because science deniers embrace a number of myths about scientific reasoning? In this talk I will discuss what I believe to be really distinctive about science -- which is not its logic or its method, but the attitude of its practitioners -- and show how this can be used to fight back against science deniers. Research has shown that push back against science deniers can be effective, with face to face encounters perhaps the most effective of all. In addition to discussing this research, I will share some details of my own recent visit to the Flat Earth International Conference, where I tried out some of these techniques in person.\"",

		"messageBody": "With the opening of Dogs! A Science Tail, we've been seeing far more furry friends onsite than typical, and wanted to share some of the FAQs we've received so far.  \n\nIf you have any additional questions, please reach out to one of the following, and we can help answer your question or direct you to the right person to help answer your question: \n\nGrace Fo \nNora Nagle\nSharon Horrigan\nJackie Peeler\n\n\nQ1.\nWhy am I seeing more dogs in the building, garage, exhibit halls?\n\nA.\nWe see service animals in the Museum almost every day. During the Dogs! A Science Tail exhibit, we have invited select organizations and individuals to partner with us to provide live education and interpretation. We are doing this in order to further the educational goals of the Museum during the run of the Dogs.\n\nQ2. \nHow are dogs being selected to participate in programs for the Dogs! exhibit?\n\nA. \nThe Dogs! A Science Tail ancillary education programming extends the learning goals of the exhibition with live dog presentations, demonstrations and educators that bring to life the exhibition themes and stories. The Museum of Science is proud to welcome community organizations such as Canine Companions for Independence, American Kennel Club, and Urban Hound along with other professionals trainers and owners. In the live demonstration area, Dog Park, Museum visitors will be invited to drop-in and have the opportunity to ask questions of trainers as well as watch demonstrations by service dogs, rescue dogs and more! Invited community members volunteer their time to help educate our visitors through conversations and demonstrations of their dogs’ amazing senses, training, and abilities. Participating dogs have suitable socialization and training to prepare them for community settings and active in breed, agility or obedience competitions and/or a service or therapy dog.  \n\nQ3.\nDoes this conflict with our service animal policy?\n\nA. \nNo. These guest presenters and their animals must travel through the building in order to get to the presentation space in Nichols. They will be accompanied by Museum staff for the entire time that they are in the building. Only service animals are allowed in areas of the building (like the cafe or exhibit halls) without a Museum staff escort.\n\nQ4.\nWhat if I see a dog in the building that does not seem like a service dog, and is not accompanied by a staff member?\n\nA. \nPlease remember that:\n-Service dogs come in all sizes and many breeds.\n-Service dogs perform many different services for their owners, many of which are not obvious.\n-Service animals DO NOT need to have identifying vests or tags.\n-Service animals in training are treated as service animals under Massachusetts laws. \n\nQ5.\nWhat if the dog that I see is misbehaving?\n\nA.\nContact public safety at x0200 if you see a dog behaving inappropriately (eliminating, bothering other guests, destroying property of the Museum or of other guests, growling, behaving aggressively, etc.). Please give a description and location.\n \nQ6.\nWhy does the Museum only allow service animals? \n\nA.\nThe Museum is following the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law requires all public places to allow trained services dogs, which are trained to do work or perform a task to assist a person with a disability, into their facilities. Other animals, like therapy dogs or emotional support animals are not covered by this law. The Museum does not allow other animals into the building in order to protect visitors, the Museum’s own live animals, Museum staff, volunteers, and property. \n \nQ7.\nWhat is the difference between Service Animals, Therapy Animals and Emotional Support Animals?\n\nA.\nPlease see the table attached.\n\n\n",

		"messageBody": "\nHi Everyone\n\nIn connection with the new exhibit “Dogs – A Science Tail,” I’ve added more canine texts to the library collection. You can find these titles and more using our Online Catalog: http://library.mos.org/\n(While in the building, this link currently works only on desktops, not wireless devices - we're looking into the problem.)\n\nI’m still working to provide museum staff with greater access to digital content. In the meantime, please feel free to utilize two existing avenues for online resources:\n\nGale Database Resources\nhttps://www.galepages.com/mlin_b_musmsci\nMuseum staff have access to a variety of online databases (many provide full-text articles) via the MA Library Databases Network. Scroll down the page and check out which portals might work for. Be sure to look at Gale in Context: Science (toward the bottom right of the page).\n\nInter Library Loans\nIf you need an article or text, perhaps from a more obscure reference, we can usually obtain it for you via our ILL subscription. Just send an email to library@mos.org, with as much bibliographic details as you can provide, and typically I can turn around your request within a week.\n\nAs always, please let me know if you have ideas for other books that you’d like to see on our shelves.\n\nJeff Mehigan | Librarian, Educator Resource Center\nPronouns: he, him, his\nWilliam and Charlotte Bloomberg Science Education Center\nMuseum of Science | 1 Science Park | Boston, MA 02114\njmehigan@mos.org  / 617.589.0174\nPlease note my schedule is Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday",
